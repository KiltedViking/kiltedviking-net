                <h2>Eskilstuna</h2>
                <h4>Old Abbey and old Castle</h4>

                <p>In Eskilstuna there was an abbey, which was destroyed to build
                  the castle, which in turn burnt down a few years later (instant
                  karma? :-). Traces of these, or at least names associated with
                  them, can be found at Castle Road (Slottsgatan) och Abbey Road
                  (Klostergatan).</p>

                <h4>The old town and churches</h4>

                <p>The old town (east of the river) is worth a walk as is a look at
                  the old Tunafors church (west of the river). The newer 'Abbey
                  Church' (Klosters kyrka, north of the river) is built in the 20th
                  centuary and is (I believe) mostly paid for by private donations.
                  It was built at the north end of the main road through town (a
                  road that now passes on the west side of the church, crossing
                  the river over an even newer bridge [than the one that was there
                  when the church was built :-)]).</p>

                <h4>Museums</h4>

                <p>Entry to Eskilstuna museums is free (at least when I wrote this)
                  and well worth a visit! In the northwest part of the town centre
                  is The Rademacher Smithies (Rademachersmedjorna), red two-storey
                  wooden buildings where, among other things, pocketknives are
                  made. Most of these smithies where moved from various locations
                  in town and concentrated here to create this (working) museum.</p>

                <p>Across the road, to the north, look at the old worker's houses
                  (now private residences!) and maybe also the gardens of a factory
                  owner (or manager?). In the gardens you will find quite a few
                  different plants (and a nice place to have a picnic/coffee). Cross
                  the bridge, north onto the islets (Faktoriholmarna), and cross
                  the courtyard to enter the Eskilstuna's Cultural Museum which,
                  among other things, shows how people lived here in the past and
                  a full scale drawing of The Sigurd Carvings (see below).</p>

                <p>Across the canal and draw bridge, and then the dam, you find
                  the Munktell Museum which shows Volvo's past machinery. (Eskilstuna's
                  art museum is supposed to be there somewhere as well... but I
                  usually don't frequent it.)</p>

                <h4>Iron Age Forts</h4>

                <p>Around Eskilstuna there are quite a few iron age forts that are
                  in very good condition, (at least) two of them within Eskilstuna
                  and yet another one within walking distance (south of Vilsta).
                  Heading north towards Sundbyholm there is a good one, The Vesta
                  Fort (Vestaborgen), just west of Vallby (take road west towards
                  Torshälla and then take road north towards Kumla, the second bigger
                  one).</p>

                <h4>Sigurd Stone Carving and Sunbyholm's Castle</h4>

                <p>In Sundbyholm (north of Eskilstuna) is one of Sweden's largest
                  stone carvings: The Sigurd Carving (Sigurdsristningen). It consists
                  of one big carving telling the story of Sigurd, Fafne's Slayer
                  (Sigurd Fafnesbane, i.e. Sigurd the slayer of the dragon Fafne).
                  The woman that commisioned the carving, Sigrid, also had a bridge
                  built across the river (now only a small stream) next to the
                  carving. If in the area, this is <b>not</b> to be missed!</p>

                <p>Sundbyholm also has a castle, or what I call an 'overgrown mansion'.
                  It actually looks like a giant barn with windows from the outside.
                  But passing through the doors it's more glamours, as is it's gardens.
                  This is also a nice place to spend the day bathing in the summer
                  (if you like lake water) and perhaps having a barbeque in the
                  evening.</p>

                <h4>Jäder's Church and Fiholm Castle</h4>

                <p>Heading east from Sunbyholm there is a small road towards Kjula
                  and Jäder. Jäder's Church is interesting because it's a big church in
                  the middle of nowhere and with barely any parishioners. It was
                  built by one of Sweden's bigwigs so that he could be buried in
                  style. Just north is Fiholm Castle, which is interesting because
                  only two of the four wings where built and there is only a big
                  hole where the main house (refered to as a 'pigsty' by the builder) was
                  supposed to be.</p>
