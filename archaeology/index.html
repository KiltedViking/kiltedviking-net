                <p class="contentsheader">Eskilstuna</p>
                <p>What can I say, Eskilstuna is a manufacturing town... But there are still some
                  buildings of interest.</p>
                <p>Most of the city centre is from the 19th or
                  20th century, even if the town dates back before the 11th century.
                  Some older wooden house,
                  mostly smithies and other craftsmen's houses, where moved to the
                  northwest of the city centre, an area called Rademacher smithies
                  (Rademachersmedjorna). Some of the smithies are still working
                  making, amoung other things, pocket knives, which Eskilstuna is
                  known for. Conveniently some old wooden houses burnt down to
                  make way for the first ugly, modern building for the university
                  (which I worked in). But nice enough they restored old factory
                  buildings for the next two blocks of the university.</p>
                <p>The town hall is interesting (and old) as is the
                  old Tunafors chuch (to the east of the square by the river).
                  South along the river is the old factory, from the time when
                  even factory buildings had an impressive facade. Across the
                  river (the east side) is the old town with many old and interesting
                  buildings. Further east is the old king's barn with an old
                  bronze age fort on top of a rock.</p>
                <p>South of the railway was, what I have seen from pictures and
                  photos, a quaint neighbourhood, only to be torn down a replaced
                  with concrete housing blocks (as part of the <acronym
                  title="The million program was a try to build housing for the masses in the 1970s.">&quot;million
                  program &quot;</acronym>). To their defence I gather the state
                  of the old houses were poorly.</p>
                <p>Unfortunatly (?) most monasteries where
                  torn down in the 16th century (for other buildings), as was
                  Eskilstuna's to build a castle, which burnt down (also in the
                  16th century). We are left with some foundations and street
                  names showing where both buildings where.</p>
                <a name="myhouse"></a>
                <p class="contentsheader">My house</p>
                <p>The last 7 years (2006) I have lived in a typical Swedish
                  house from the 1940s (another &quot;million program&quot;). The
                  craftsmenship is crappy and the building material is not top
                  notch, but it's good wood (not like today's where it rots in a
                  few years if mishandled). If I drop a marble I know where to
                  look for it (in one of house's corners). :-)</p>

                <p class="contentsheader">Malmk&ouml;ping</p>
                <p>Malmk&ouml;ping is a small quaint town to the south of
                  Eskilstuna. It is an old regimental town (cavalry) and has a
                  military vehicle museum (Swedish vehicles). It
                  has a tram-car museum, even though the town never has been
                  big enough for trams. The trams run on the old railway line
                  (which nowadays run east of Malmk&ouml;ping).</p>
                <p>Malmk&ouml;ping is part of Flen's municipality (see Flen for
                  more information in English).</p>

                <p>Str&auml;ngn&auml;s is a small quaint town to the east of
                  Eskilstuna. It has been a Christian centre for a long time and
                  some bishop (or rather) is placed there. It is also an old
                  regimental town (armour), down-sized in recent years.</p>
