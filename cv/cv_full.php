        <h4 id="who_is" class="mt-4">Who is Bj&ouml;rn?</h4>
        
        <p>I was born in B&aring;stad in the south of Sweden in 1970 by a Swedish father and
          a Scottish mother. Most of my summers were spent in Scotland
          visiting my grandmother and aunt. This, and my mother speaking English
          to me, meant I became bilingual and fluent in both Swedish and English.
        </p>

        <p>I now live in Stockholm, the Swedish capital, but I have also
          lived in the towns Halmstad, V&auml;xj&ouml;, Eskilstuna, and
          V&auml;ster&aring;s. While working for M&auml;lardalen University,
          I bought a house in Eskilstuna in 1999, which I sold in 2006. But for my
          flat and work, there is nothing tying me to my current location and I’d relish
          a new location to explore (but I would miss my local friends and colleagues).
        </p>

        <p>My interest for computers started when my childhood friend lured me
          to start, what was to become, one of Sweden's largest BBS:es
          (multiple phone lines, computers, CD-ROM switchers, etc.). Shortly
          after that I bought my own computer, a computer I've extended,
          and replaced, quite a few times. When I had enough hardware I
          built my own network at home to help me learn more about computers
          and networking.</p>

        <p>I like computers (and other electronic things) and solving computer-related
          problems as it requires me to learn new things all the time. And
          helping others, seeing them smile when the understand or things
          work, is gratifying for me.</p>

        <h4 id="education" class="mt-4">Education</h4>
        
        <p>Compulsory school in Sweden is (or was when I went to school)
          nine years, preparing you for 'optional' (upper) secondary school
          (three to five years), to be followed by studies at University.</p>

        <p>My main studies at secondary school were about engineering,
          but also included English, German, and other non-engineering subjects.
          The last year I specialised in structural engineering (house building).<br />
          After working a couple of years (see below) I went on to University
          studying computer science, computer engineering, mathematics, and
          information systems. After finishing my bachelor thesis in
          information systems, and started working, I kept on studying
          to expand my knowledge, mainly in information systems. (My employers
          have been nice enough to spend money on courses in handling customers
          and computer technologies - like Novell NetWare).</p>

        <p>During my studies I have come in contact with programming languages
          like Ada, Pascal, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Prolog, C/C++, Visual Basic
          (5/6), Java, and assembler (Motorola 68000). Databases (or rather
          DBMS:s) I have used are Paradox, Access (Jet), Oracle (including
          PL/SQL) and MySQL. The programming has been done on different
          platforms (PC, Mac, and UNIX computers) using different operating
          systems (DOS, Windows, OS/2, MacOS, Linux, and UNIX).</p>

        <p>As administrator for the Fieldbiologists (F&auml;ltbiologerna) I ran
          the district office where I answered the phone, arranged courses
          (booking halls and the like), spoke at schools about the organisation,
          and more. This was partly voluntary work (i.e. badly paid) and
          only during school year. The rest of the year I worked for the
          camping site KronoCamping B&aring;stad/Torekov as a 'handy man', i.e.
          doing what needed to be done. (Dom&auml;nTurist has since sold most
          of it's camping sites and other vacation resorts.)</p>

        <p>Military service is (was?) compulsory and I spent 341 days looking
          at the weather, i.e. reporting it to the air traffic controllers
          and Swedish weather service (SMHI). During my service I managed
          to keep on working hours at the camp site.</p>

        <p>In a break in University studies I worked for a small company,
          Buller Data AB, selling CD-ROM and multimedia products (which
          were news in 1994). Being a small company (at most 4 employees) one took
          part in most of the running of the business. This included sales
          as well as distribution (packaging) and customer support for sold
          products. (The company, and the domain Sverige.net, has since
          been sold.)</p>

        <p>During my lecturing at university I have taught in programming
          languages like Visual Basic (6), Visual C++, Smalltalk, Java,
          and C# using DMBS like Access (Jet), Oracle, SQL Server, and
          MySQL. I have also taught subjects like database theory and
          design, and object oriented programming (i.e. the theory of OOP
          and how to implement it in Java). On a course about component-based
          development I have taught both COM/COM+/.NET and J2EE using both
          desktop (local) and web-based clients. I have also taught web-based
          development with ASP and ASP.NET. Most of the education has
          been done in a Microsoft environment (DOS/Windows).</p>

        <p>One of my strengths (and according to students who have told me)
          is my ability to explain computer-related problems/technologies
          to less computer literary people. I can 'lower' myself to their
          level of knowledge or even try to use terms in their area of
          expertise/knowlegde as metaphors.</p>

        <p>As a systems administrator I have installed and maintained computer
          rooms with operating systems varying between DOS/Windows 3.x to
          XP using servers running Novell NetWare (3.12 to 6) and Windows
          NT/2000/2003. Server software I have installed and maintained
          are Oracle, SQL Server, web servers (IIS and Apache), and application
          servers (among others Resin for J2EE). As a systems administrator
          my job was also to maintain and develop the department's  web
          site using HTML, CSS, SSI, PHP, and some older systems in ASP.
          Data was stored in MySQL and Oracle servers.</p>
          
        <p>While working at Ecolabelling Sweden, I maintained and developed web 
          sites using ASP.NET and SQL Server. The web sites where custom developed 
          systems. I also maintained informational web sites using a custom version
          of ISpyBuy Portal, DotNetNuke, and EPiServer as CMS, which required some 
          development, both frontend and backend. I also installed and maintained
          the company's computers as well as acted as local support.
        </p>

        <p>Privately I have helped a lot of my (non-computer) friends and
          family install/service computers, connect to Internet, and setup networks.
          In 2007 I helped to create an administrative interface
          for an non-profit organisation. I have also helped evaluate, and install, 
          different CMS (Concrete5, Drupal, Joomla, Tikiwiki, Umbraco, 
          Website Baker, and WordPress) for other organisations and persons.</p>

        <h4 id="languages" class="mt-4">Languages</h4>

        <p>Swedish is my first language, having been brought up in Sweden and done 
          all my studying there, which includes the subject Swedish all through primary 
          and secondary schooling.</p>
      
        <p>My English is not far behind, having been brought up bilingual by British 
          mother and Swedish father, spent most of my childhood summers in Scotland 
          with grandmother, aunt and cousins, and having studied English as a second 
          language up to level B2 at school, as well as receiving highest grade in 
          the subject, so is equal to level C1.</p>

        <p>Having spent 5 years studying German, but not really having practiced it, 
          my level is A2.</p>
        
        <h4 id="interests" class="mt-4">Interests</h4>
        
        <p>I find problem solving the most interesting. It's a way of learning
          more and it's gratifying to solve a problem. Helping others is
          also rewarding for me and I like sharing my knowledge with others.
          While helping others I will do what needs to be done, regardless
          if it is part of my work description or not, if there is no one
          else to do the job better.</p>

        <p>During the years I have looked into .NET Framework, J2EE and PHP/MySQL
          while becoming fascinated by the idea behind frameworks.</p>

        <p>During my  years I have tried to avoid designing user interfaces (UI)
          and Perl - two thing I feel other people are more competent at
          handling (as I believe my website proves :-)).</p>

        <p>Having been brought up next to a railway, this has influenced my interest
          in railways, together with my grandfather working for the railway and
          growing up around persons with an interest for railways. Trains have also
          been my preferred mode of transport, both in my daily life and while holidaying.
          Learning that the train is the more energy efficient way of transport
          has strengthened my belief in railways.
        </p>

        <h4 id="projects" class="mt-4">Private projects</h4>

        <p>I have some private computer-related projects, which I started
          to develop as part of a course at &Ouml;rebro University (2000), and
          to summarize for myself and to help students on courses I taught.
          These projects are <b>only in Swedish</b> (as it was the preferred
          language of students I taught).</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a target="_blank" href="../se/www/">My study web</a> - web-based
          knowledgebase for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP, PHP, and Java.</li>

          <li><a target="_blank" href="../se/sammanfattningar/">My summaries</a>
          - PDF files with summaries about COM/COM+/.NET, J2EE, web-based
          development, and installing development and server software (like
          Apache, MySQL, PHP, Resin, and Oracle).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I also maintain this site, kiltedviking.net, to keep up my
          knowledge about web development and to share things with my
          friends. (It also gave me a reason to register the domain and
          an e-mail address I enjoy and can keep, regardless
          of any employer. :-))</p>

        <h4 id="accomplishments" class="mt-4">Private accomplishments</h4>
        <p>In 2019, I climbed Ben Nevis, Scotland's highest point at 1.345 m (which
          took me about 4 hours to walk the 8 km up and about 2 hours back down),
          and Ben Vrackie at 841 m, but since also Shetland's highest point, Ronas Hill
          at 450 m. ;-)</p>
