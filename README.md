# About repository KiltedViking/kiltedviking-net #

This repository contains my personal website, kiltedviking.net, and has been shared publicly, should somebody want to know how I designed the site using the different front-end frameworks (in CSS, with and without JavaScript).

But the main reason for adding site to repostiory is to keep track of its code and a reason for me to learn more about Git. ;-)

My site is in both English and Swedish - mostly the latter. The Swedish content is found in the folder /se and subfolders.
