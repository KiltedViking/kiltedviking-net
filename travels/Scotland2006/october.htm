        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In July 2006 I sold my house (in Eskilstuna) and bought a caravan (a Cabby
          440 DL from 1987 if you must know :-). At the end of August I drove down
          to Gothenburg to catch the ferry to Newcastle and then further
          north into Scotland.</p>
        <p>This trip has been split into three parts: September, parts 1 and 2, and
          October.
        </p>
        <p>In this third part, I left for home, i.e. headed down to Newcastle to
          catch ferry to Gothenburg (a route no longer available).

        <h2>October</h2>

        <h3>Fife (continued)</h3>
        <p>My stay in Fife lasted for about 2 weeks, partly as I enjoyed
          taking it easy after having lugged my caravan around Scotland
          for more than 4 weeks, and having to repair my car (something
          to do with steering/suspension that always wears/breaks on
          my make and model of car). Below are the short trips I took
          during this period.</p>

        <p>Monday (2/10) was used to tour the south coast of Fife. The
          tour started in <a href="IMG_1661.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Lower Largo</a> where
          Arthur Selkirk, whom the <a href="IMG_1679.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Robinson
          Crusoe</a> character is based on, <a href="IMG_1678.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">lived</a>.
          Moving on to Leven I booked my ticket home and had lunch. Next
          was East Wemyss with it's <a href="IMG_1708.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">caves</a>,
          with carvings from as far back as the Picts, and <a href="IMG_1700.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">MacDuff's
          castle</a> above the caves. (There is a story about a secret
          path from the castle down to the Well Cave, something Mr. Robinson
          [not Crusoe :-)] and Time Team tried to prove.) West Wemyss and
          it's <a href="IMG_1724.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">newly renovated house</a> was visited
          next as was Coaltown of Wemyss with it's <a href="IMG_1750.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">rows
          of houses</a>. <a href="IMG_1759.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Pan Ha</a> of Dysart and
          the St. Serf's tower (of old church) came next. Unfortunately
          a constant drissle started and the rest of the trip was a bit
          wet and dark. But a quick visit to <a href="IMG_1777.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Ravenscraig's
          castle</a>, Kirkcaldy, and a walk through <a href="IMG_1808.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">North
          Queensferry</a>, below the Forth Railway Bridge, was taken.</p>

        <p>On wednesday (4/10) I got a pretty good photo of the <a href="IMG_1816.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">sky
          and sea</a> as I was leaving the camp site. Thursday (5/10) was used to tour the
          southeast of Fife, i.e. the East Neuk of Fife. I started of at
          Upper Largo church to try to find a crazy man's canal, that
          he used to sail between his house and the church. Unfortunately
          it's completly gone but I got to see the <a href="IMG_1818.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">headstone</a>
          of Mr. Selkirk's parents and <a href="IMG_1821.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">nice houses</a>
          nearby. Next I took a walk down <a href="IMG_1841.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">High Street</a>
          of Earlsferry, taking photos of many nice houses, and the
          <a href="IMG_1857.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">centre of Elie</a>, yet again taking
          photos of nice houses. Lunch was had at the award winning fish
          and chip shop in Anstruther's harbour (it was one of the best
          F&C I have had this trip, but it was all served on paper plate
          and in styrofoam [spelling?] mugs, which doesn't match the
          price of the meal). It had started to rain
          and I was running out of time...</p>

        <p>Friday (6/10) was to be used for a trip to Pitlochry via Newtyle,
          Alyth, and Kirkmichael. On the way I stopped at Highham Toll to
          look at an <a href="IMG_1859.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">'old' road sign</a> (which
          turned out to be modern with an old design). Hearing strange
          sounds from my car (as I usually do, but only to turn out to be
          my imagination) I tried to replicate them before going on. Time
          flew and it was time for lunch, which was had at <a href="IMG_1860.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">St.
          Andrews' Harbour</a>. Deciding not to venture to far with a
          possibly broken car I decided to go 'home'. On the way I got
          to take a closer look at a <b>real</b> <a href="IMG_1863.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">road
          sign</a> on my way to Crail. Outside Crail I took a another
          look at my car and found a broken thingamy in the stearing (or
          whatever). So I drove back to Lundin Links (or is it Lower Largo?)
          and booked a time for having my car repaired. In the evening I
          took a walk down the village (to shop and eat) and got some
          pretty good photos, like a view of <a href="IMG_1865.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">fields
          and sea</a>, <a href="IMG_1868.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Largo Law and a dovecot</a>,
          and the <a href="IMG_1881.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">moon reflecting in the sea</a>
          at Lower Largo. The last photo was taken while I was playing
          with the Nightshot setting of my camera. (Please note that I
          have only owned this camera for a few weeks. :-)</p>

        <p>Feeling a cold coming on (which was not to be :-), I spent
          saturday (7/10) taking it easy. Got to update this travel
          description (mostly adding pictures) and some reading done.
          Took a walk in the windy weather to do some shopping. And on
          the sunday (8/10) I went for a walk in the afternoon. After
          yet another tour of <a href="IMG_1890.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Lower Largo</a> I
          walked to Leven. During the walk I was 'beachcombing' and found
          my first piece of sea coal. (That is coal brought to the beach
          by the sea. In Fife most coal seams extend under the sea, as
          does a lot of other mines in Wales.) On the monday (9/10) my car was
          to be repaired, but no part to repair with. But I got a quick
          walk of Cupar and a photo of an old <a href="IMG_1900.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Toll
          House</a>. (Turnpike roads where built in Fife to make it easier
          to travel and the travellers had to pay tolls to use them. Road
          signs documented above are the ones that marked the distances
          along the roads.)</p>

        <p>Wednesday (11/10), and a new day to try to get my car fixed...
          and it was to be! :-) Headed for Leven to have coffee (and make
          time pass). Walked <a href="IMG_1926.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">the beach</a>, but
          then got bored (even though I got some great 'artistic' photos).
          So I decided to go to <a href="IMG_1953.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Anstruther</a>
          for lunch. Returned to Lundin Links and got my repaired car.</p>

        <h3>Fife to England [TODO: Add pictures]</h3>
        <p>Before leaving from Newcastle on the 16/10 I had an idea of
          visiting the Trossachs, Stirling, Edinburgh, and staying in (or outside)
          Dunbar to visit places like Dirleton castle (as I've been to
          Tantallon castle), St. Abbs, Eyemouth, Holy Island, Kelso,
          Bamburgh, and Alnwick. But having my car break changed my plans.
          On the thursday (12/10) I headed for England (yikes!). I ended
          up at a camp site south of Embleton (northeast of Alnwick). First thing (after having
          'rigged' my caravan) I headed for the beach and got to see
          <a href="IMG_1957.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Dunstanburgh Castle</a> 
          and <a href="IMG_1964.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Bamburgh
          Castle</a> at a distance. Heading north I visited High
          Newton-by-the-Sea, Beadnell, and Seahouses. In Seahouses I got a nice
          view of the Farne Islands. And just south of
          Bamburgh are some nice <a href="IMG_1982.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">dunes</a>...</p>

        <p>It's friday the 13th! Time for Holy Island... Holy Island is
          reached by a <a href="IMG_1998.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">causeway</a> that is covered
          by the tide twice a day (the green stuff is seaweed). On the island
          there is an old <a href="IMG_2026.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">abbey</a>, 
          a <a href="IMG_2056.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">castle</a>,
          and the very <a href="IMG_2046.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">special sheds</a> made out
          of old boats. Headed south in the afternoon to check for a new
          camp site, and in so doing I made a quick visit to Alnwick, Warkworth,
          Amble (with a nice <a href="IMG_2063.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">time piece</a>), and
          Alnmouth.</p>

        <p>On saturday (14/10) I moved to Ashington. While there I took
          a tour of North Shields (to scout for monday's departure), Tynemouth
          (for a quick lunch and external view of the abbey in the mist),
          and up the coast. Among other things I saw <a href="IMG_2100.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Seaton
          Sluice</a>. I must say I feel cheated about what I have been shown
          of Morpeth on previous trips... or rather not. On this visit I
          found out that there is more than the street where 'the book shop'
          is (and also that our 'usual' parking lot now has a block of flats
          in it).</p>

        <p>Sunday (15/10) was used to make a closer tour of <a href="IMG_2114.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">Alnwick</a>,
          with it's <a href="IMG_2124.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">old gate house</a> (that contributes
          to long queues during rush hour) and Warkworth. In Warkworth there's
          a <a href="IMG_2127.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">castle</a> at the top of the hill and
          a church at the bottom (which seems to be common in England),
          and it has a nice bridge and gate by the river (where I also found
          a small Swedish flag flying outside a house).</p>

        <p>Monday (16/10) and departure for Sweden. :-( Probably the last
          time I get to take a photo of the <a href="IMG_2151.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="october">fishes
          at North Shields</a> (as the ferry to Gothenburg has been sold).<br>
          (OK, so my tourist fatigue syndrome made me book my trip home...
          and England doesn't excite me as Scotland does. And to be fair,
          the cost of living in another country while paying an expensive
          exchange rate doesn't help either... and needing to look at my
          'snail mail'.) One good thing was that the crossing was calm.
          Didn't need those two Irish Coffees, buy they tasted good.
          ... and might keep a cold away :-).</p>
