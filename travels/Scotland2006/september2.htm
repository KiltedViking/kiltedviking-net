        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In July 2006 I sold my house (in Eskilstuna) and bought a caravan (a Cabby
          440 DL from 1987 if you must know :-). At the end of August I drove down
          to Gothenburg to catch the ferry to Newcastle and then further
          north into Scotland.</p>

        <p>This trip has been split into three parts: September, parts 1 and 2, and
          October.
        </p>
        <p>In this second part, I travelled from Dornoch to the top of Scottish mainland,
          then down to Inverness and along the Northeastern coast towards Stonehaven, 
          and finally down the East coast to Lundin Links.
        </p>

        <h2>September, part 2</h2>

        <h3>Ullapool to Dornoch (continued)</h3>
        <p>Friday (15/9) turned out to become a rather nice day and I
          had lunch in <a href="IMG_0865.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Tain</a>, where I also
          picked up an OK curry. The day
          was otherwise used to catch up on some reading.</p>

        <p>Saturday (16/9) started off very <a href="IMG_0888.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">foggy</a>
          but also turned out a nice
          day. Yet another day to catch up on things I have had on
          backburner for a while...</p>

        <p>Will sunday (17/9) be the day I get to Thurso? Yes, it was! :-)
          I started off by a visit to the <a href="IMG_0894.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">broch</a> south of Brora, which
          was followed up by a visit to the previous clearance village of
          <a href="IMG_0927.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Badbea</a>. (The Clearances was when landowners evicted tenants from
          their crofts to let, the more lucrative, sheep graze on the land.
          The crofters had to move to the, most often less fertile, coast
          and start again.) Georgemas Junction was a must (if boring)
          before arriving in Thurso, which failed to impress me as well.<br>
          Nicer where the <a href="IMG_0972.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">sand dunes</a> east of
          Thurso as well as <a href="IMG_0978.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Dunnet Head</a>,
          the northern tip of Scottish mainland. Moving on <a href="IMG_0994.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">John o' Groats</a>
          was a commercial disappointment (for me), but the trip down to
          Wick had it's points (mostly nice <a href="IMG_1001.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">old houses</a>). Wick is not either
          a place I feel compelled to return to and yet again, the trip
          south from there had it's points. Got a good photo of the <a href="IMG_1007.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">sun
          shining on a lighthouse</a>. Unfortunally it started raining
          so I decided to skip the cairns and standing stones. :-(</p>

        <p>For monday (18/9) I had nothing planned... The afternoon
          was used to try and get connected to the Internet (and be allowed
          to connect my USB memory to upload this home page). I ended up
          picking up a chinese take-away in Golspie, which produced some
          photos while I was waiting for it. On the way back I got a
          glimpse of the old light railway between Dornoch and The Mound.</p>

        <h3>Dornoch to Bunchrew (Inverness)</h3>
        <p>On tuesday (19/9) I moved south again to Bunchrew just
          west of Inverness. The afternoon was spent browsing in
          Dingwall and Strathpeffer. It started of with a futile visit to North
          Kessock to try to see some dolphins (though a nice view of the
          <a href="IMG_1043.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">old ferry crossing and Inverness</a> :-).
          Next was Dingwall, with it's nice <a href="IMG_1049.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">town
          hall</a> and typical British <a href="IMG_1062.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">railway
          station</a> (where 134 864 men where supplied with tea during
          WW1). In Strathpeffer yet another railway station was visited,
          <a href="IMG_1085.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Strathpeffer Spa</a> (closed, as is the 'main' Strathpeffer station,
          2 miles outside the village). I took a walk along the old track
          bed of the branch line ("spa line"), overlooked by two old <a href="IMG_1094.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">bronze
          age forts</a>. Looked at another pictish stone, the <a href="IMG_1099.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Eagle
          Stone</a>, and some of the <a href="IMG_1110.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">hotels</a>.
          I guess I saw the <a href="IMG_1114.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">start of the autumn</a>
          as well.<br>
          I finally got connected to Internet! Too bad I failed to upload
          the pictures, etc. for this home page...:-( (But by now that will
          have been fixed! :-)</p>

        <p>The Black Isle was toured on the wednesday (20/9). It started
          of with a quick visit to Fortrose and it's cathedral, where I
          picked up a lunch that was eaten (<a href="IMG_1131.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">looking
          at the waves</a>) at Chanonry Point trying to
          spot a dolphin (but alas not...). I continued on further out
          on the penninsula (no, it's not actually an island :-) ending
          up at Cromarty, with a view of the North Sea <a href="IMG_1145.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">between
          the Sutors</a>. On the way back I stopped off at Beauly to
          look at the priory. Unfortunately it was a bit after lunch,
          i.e. not to many photos were taken...<br>
          (A quick visit to Inverness was managed,
          where I got to complete my collection of books on Scottish
          railways, snap some photos of railway station [quite boring] and
          a first look at Caledonian Canal - more on that 'tomorrow'.)</p>

        <p>Thursday (21/9) and it's time for <a href="IMG_1168.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Culloden</a>!
          (Culloden, 1746, was the last battle on British soil where the
          troops of Bonnie Prince Charles fought the English... and lost. After this
          the English came down on the Scots and forbade the wearing of
          tartans, the use of bagpipes, and other things related to the
          Scottish clan system. Yes, yes... There isn't much to see on the
          moor, except perhaps the <a href="IMG_1184.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">cairn</a> and
          stones with clan names raised by Scottish descendants.)
          The moor was pretty windy but moving on to <a href="IMG_1210.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Clava
          cairns</a>, amoung other <a href="IMG_1229.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">passage graves</a>,
          in the woods was a big change. Lunch was had in Nairn, a town
          I could not find a reason to like before I went. And having been
          there I still can't find a reason... at least none more than
          Dornoch or Thurso (i.e. has a <a href="IMG_1248.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">nice beach</a>
          and a summer holiday might be nice there).
          I gave Cawdor Castle (but not there <a href="IMG_1237.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">lovely
          trees</a> :-) a miss as did I Fort George (as they cost a bit
          of money and I actually got a better view of the fort across
          the firth yesterday). Having missed the opportunity to get a
          <a href="IMG_1258.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">good view</a> of the railway viaduct at
          Clava cairns (and as I had time to spare) I went back to get a
          <a href="IMG_1266.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">closer look</a>. :-) I got a nice look
          at a small burn, that had '<a href="IMG_1275.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">eaten</a>'
          itself in to the rock, and the 'small' bridge (compared to
          Culloden Viaduct) over it.<br>
          Back in 'the world', i.e. Inverness, I took a closer look at
          the Caledonian Canal and the railway swing bridge.</p>

        <h3>Bunchrew to Cullen</h3>
        <p>Friday (22/9) and 'moving day' again... I started off trying
          for Huntly, only to find the campsite full (a first for me! :-).
          I therefore pushed on to Cullen on the north coast. The
          afternoon was spent revisiting Elgin, a place I made a quick
          visited to a few years ago. Obviously I missed the <a href="IMG_1298.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">cathedral</a>
          last time, but my liking of Elgin has not improved. One good
          thing is that the <a href="IMG_1306.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">square</a> has become nicer as the traffic has
          been moved to a by-pass. In all fairness to Elgin (and Thurso,
          Wick, and Nairn) - I'm not a fan of towns. The
          <a href="IMG_1308.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">evening sun</a> was nice, just before
          it started to rain.</p>

        <p>Saturday (23/9) and time to see Huntly, amoung other things, which I
          'missed' staying at. The day started of a bit overcast but when the sun
          hit the <a href="IMG_1314.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">rocks</a>, the view from the camp
          site was really nice. I started of by touring <a href="IMG_1317.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Cullen</a>
          and documenting it's many <a href="IMG_1324.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">railway bridges</a>
          (now unused), harbour, and <a href="IMG_1330.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">beach</a>. A
          quick visit to Fochaber's <a href="IMG_1339.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">square</a>,
          as it reminded me of Grantown-on-Spey's square (although a bit smaller
          :-). Good old Lennox was nice enough to introduce electric light
          to Fochaber. Moving on I went to Keith and toured railway station
          (won't bore you with that :-), <a href="IMG_1365.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Milton Tower</a>,
          <a href="IMG_1371.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">new town</a>, 
          <a href="IMG_1372.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">old
          town</a> (with 2 RR for wedding party), and got a glimpse of whisky
          <a href="IMG_1375.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">storage</a> 
          and <a href="IMG_1377.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">vats</a>.
          (Saw a limousine in Cullen, for another wedding party, and yet
          another on the way to Keith, or was it the same one?)<br>
          Pushing on to Huntly I saw the <a href="IMG_1381.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">square</a>
          (without the caravan this time! :-) and it's <a href="IMG_1384.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">town
          hall</a> (and railways station of course, but won't bore you
          with that either :-). Then headed 'home' to do some washing...</p>

        <p>Sunday (24/9) was used to see more of the east: Banff, Macduff,
          Gardenstown, Portsoy, Sandend, and Fordyce. Banff was seen in
          the rain... so not to many photos. But I got to see the <a href="IMG_1393.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">moat
          of the old castle</a> (which is no more) and yet more <a href="IMG_1394.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">nice
          houses</a>. Had my lunch (from Banff) outside the Marine Museum
          in Macduff (still in the rain). I think I saw the less interesting
          side of Macduff because I was quick to push on to Gardenstown, where I had
          coffee in a café/gallery with lots of good photos in many shapes
          (pictures, coasters, table mats, and more). I myself got a pretty
          <a href="IMG_1399.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">good photo</a> towards Crovie, I must
          say. :-) (Gardenstown had to be visited as I saw the zig-zag
          road in my road atlas, and it didn't disappoint me. The view
          wasn't to bad either in the mist. :-)<br>
          Portsoy's 17th century <a href="IMG_1414.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">harbour</a> was
          nice, as was it's old streets. Got a '<a href="IMG_1409.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">good
          view</a>' as well. :-) <a href="IMG_1422.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Sandend</a> has
          a nice beach and next to the old distillery (now only used to
          store whisky) an <a href="IMG_1428.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">old 
            windmill</a> (called
          The Cup and Saucer and strangely enough built on top of a bronze
          age burial cairn). Lastly I took a walk around Fordyce, visiting
          it's <a href="IMG_1431.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">church</a>, 
          <a href="IMG_1435.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">lime
          kilns</a>, workshop (and the workshop's 'Internet café'),
          <a href="IMG_1444.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">castle</a>, 
          and <a href="IMG_1446.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">old
          church</a> (where forestry work was being done).</p>

        <h3>Cullen to Stonehaven</h3>
        <p>On monday (25/9) I moved again... Stonehaven was the destination
          and the early afternoon was used to tour the <a href="IMG_1452.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" 
          data-gallery="september2">beach</a>,
          the <a href="IMG_1462.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">harbour</a>, 
          and old town and <a href="IMG_1467.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">town
          hall</a>. I now know where Mackie (icecream maker) '<a href="IMG_1482.JPG" 
          data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">lives</a>',
          and he has to be a wee man. :-) Having seen photos of <a href="IMG_1490.JPG" 
          data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Dunottar
          Castle</a> I just had to see it for myself! Result: 90 pictures!
          :-) A quick tour of railway station before supper was fitted in.
          After a wet afternoon the evening turned out <a href="IMG_1590.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" 
          data-gallery="september2">quite
          nice</a>. (The day also produced two videos
          of the waves at the beach - one to count the waves and one to
          get the noise of the shingle when the waves retract.)</p>

        <p>Tuesday (26/9) was spent driving west from Stonehaven. I took
          a slightly closer look at Montrose and Arbroath. The <a href="IMG_1594.JPG" 
          data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">library</a>
          in Montrose, built by Andrew Carnegie, is very nice. The boring
          station was visited, where I got a great view of the basin at
          <a href="IMG_1603.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">low 
            tide</a>. On the way back I stopped
          off to look at the basin at <a href="IMG_1628.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">high tide</a>
          to compare. The <a href="IMG_1608.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">cathedral</a> in Arbroath
          was massive in it's day - larger than St. Andrews. The promenade
          was interesting, but must be nicer when the tide is in. Visited
          the <a href="IMG_1623.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">Signaling Tower</a> and it's museum
          (the tower was used to signal the <a href="IMG_1625.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">lighthouse</a>
          11 miles out, i.e. the tiny, tiny thing far, far out in the
          middle of photo, and to house the families of the lighthouse workers).
          I remembered to stop on the way home and take a closer photo
          of Stonehaven's <a href="IMG_1632.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september2">war memorial</a>, that
          features in photos on the hill above Stonehaven, and a <a href="IMG_1633.JPG"

          i.e. got a bit bored of touring.)</p>

        <h3>Stonehaven to St. Andrews/Lundin Links</h3>
        <p>On thursday I have to be in Fife, hopefully to meet my
          cousin Catherine and her 'Wee Iain'. I decided to move on the wednesday
          (27/9) and found my second camp site that was full (outside
          Dairsie). So I ended up 'on a hill' above St. Andrews (not
          above East Sands though and not Craigtoun :-). I stayed here for two nights before
          moving to Lundin Links (which was less than 2/3 of the St. A.
          price). Visiting my aunt and uncle has meant less tours (i.e.
          less photos). On saturday (30/9) Catherine, Robert, and 'Wee Iain'
          came to Cupar, where the 'Kilted Viking' (and his beard) was
          a bit frightening to start with... :-) ... and on sunday (1/10)
          Grant, Vicky, and Chloe came to Cupar. (If I stay a bit longer
          maybe the Kiwis will come as well. :-) The stay at Lundin Links
          lasted for almost two week and only a few short trips where
          taken.</p>

        <p class="centre">Continued in October.</p>
