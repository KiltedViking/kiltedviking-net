        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In July 2006 I sold my house (in Eskilstuna) and bought a caravan (a Cabby
          440 DL from 1987 if you must know :-). At the end of August I drove down
          to Gothenburg to catch the ferry to Newcastle and then further
          north into Scotland.</p>

        <p>This trip has been split into three parts: September, part 1 and 2, and
          October.
        </p>
        <p>In this first part, I travelled from Eskilstuna to Gothenburg, to catch
          ferry to Newcastle, and then headed up the
          west coast of Scotland visiting Kyle of Lochalsh, Inverewe, Ullapool and
          Lochinver, before a longer stay in Dornoch.
        </p>

        <h2>September, part 1</h2>

        <h3>Eskilstuna to Newcastle (via Gothenburg)</h3>
        <p>On my way to Gothenburg (28/8) I stopped to look at
          an <a href="IMG_0041.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1"
          alt="Old monastary along E20 motorway, Sweden">old monastary</a> (or rather I needed
          to 'wash my hands' :-).
          Leaving Gothenburg (30/8), as well as arriving in Newcastle (31/8), I felt
          I hade to snap some photos (I won't bore you with these :-).
          The voyage was not one of the
          better ones I have had, and <a href="IMG_0080.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Wabbit</a>
          (by courtesy of Helen, Laila, and Mona) and
          I felt a bit <a href="IMG_0079.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">lonely</a>. But <a
          href="img_0084.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">arriving in Newcastle</a> meant the night
          was forgotten. :-)</p>

        <h3>Newcastle to Kyle of Lochalsh</h3>
        <p>I hade planned to take a few days to reach the north of Scotland, i.e. I felt I
          could see some things on the way. The first night (31/8) was spent in
          Gretna, just on the other side of the border between England
          and Scotland. I actually spent the night at a camp site just
          behind the <a href="IMG_0097.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">famous marriage room</a>
          (the first house in Scotland).<br>(For those not in-the-know:
          Some laws in Scotland where a bit different from the ones in
          England before [some still are I think], like being able to get married at a younger
          age. A bunch of English youngsters therefore went to Scotland to
          get married, like in Gretna.)<br>
          (And for those that wonder: No, I don't find driving on the
          wrong... sorry, left side of the road a problem. I have been
          known to drive on the left side in Sweden though. :-)</p>

          <p>From Gretna I had planned to drive to the north side
          of Loch Lomond (like Ardlui) and spend the night there... but I ended up
          going all the way to Glencoe (never been good at reading road
          signs). After Tarbet I almost regreted my road choice... (they
          call that an A road!?!). The A82 is a
          <b>very</b> narrow and winding road between Tarbert and
          Crianlarich. (I was happy I had bought
          a 'normal' width caravan and not a wide one). A nice stop at
          <a href="IMG_0122.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Inveruglas</a> was welcome. But the last leg was
          amazing and well worth it, like the road down <a href="IMG_0149.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Glen Coe</a>! (I wonder why I have never been here
          before?) I have to go back this way one of these days because
          I missed a lot. The night (1/9) was spent on <a href="IMG_0155.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Loch Leven</a>.</p>

        <p>On the third day (2/9) I drove from Glencoe to just east of Kyle of
          Lochalsh, <a href="IMG_0223.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Balmacara</a> to be exakt. Before leaving Glencoe I did
          a quick tour round <a href="IMG_0168.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Loch Leven</a>. On the
          way I passed The Commando Memorial, with a nice view towards
          <a href="IMG_0179.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Ben Nevis</a> (which is hidden by clouds
          in photo), and got a good view high
          above <a href="IMG_0191.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Loch Garry</a>.<br>
          It has been almost 20 years since I took the train from
          Pitlochry to Inverness and onto Kyle of Lochalsh and back (in
          one day!). The harbour has changed a lot since they built the
          <a href="IMG_0212.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">bridge to Skye</a>, I guess.<br>
          I spent three nights here as it was pretty quiet (and cheap :-)
          and I had to see <a href="IMG_0243.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Eilean Donan Castle</a>
          (and maybe Skye close-up,
          which I never did even though the toll for the bridge now is
          gone).</p>

        <h3>Kyle of Lochalsh to Gairloch</h3>
        <p>I had planned to move to Kinlochewe on the tuesday (5/9) if the road were suitable
          for my driving skills with a caravan. I had to pass a 14% grade
          (at Attadale and one slightly less before that) before reaching Kinlochewe and my cars
          manual says "don't exceed 12%"... I managed to get over the
          hill (at 25 km/h at the top) and reach Kinlochewe. On the way I stopped to watch two
          trains meet at <a href="IMG_0265.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Strathcarron 
          station</a> (after having been <a href="IMG_0247.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">overtaken</a>
          by the eastbound one).
          Once in Kinlochewe I decided to push on to Gairloch, which ended up becoming
          Strath just a mile further along the coast. I set up my caravan
          with a most <a href="IMG_0267.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">agreeable view</a> and went to Poolewe to meet my
          parents, and aunt and uncle (who had rented a bungalow there).</p>

        <p>The next day (6/9) was spent <a href="IMG_0277.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">beachcombing</a> (at least the older
          generation) with my mothers friend Barbara and having lunch
          at the harbour of Gairloch (or is it An Ard?). Some of us also went on
          a <a href="IMG_0285.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">wild goose chase</a> for a lighthouse and a cafe only to later
          realize that we never got far enough.</p>

        <p>Thursday (7/9) was for painting (once again the older generation) at
          <a href="IMG_0299.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Mellon Udrigle</a>, a very nice giant
          <a href="IMG_0316.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">sand beach</a>. It was a bit grey
          but the sun blessed us with it's <a href="IMG_0320.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">presence</a> just after lunch.
          Coffee/tea was had at a cafe and crafts shop in Aultbea <a href="IMG_0327.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">overlooking
          Loch Ewe</a> where we meet an Irish-Australian lady on holiday in
          Scotland. Before supper <a href="IMG_0339.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Poolewe</a> was
          toured and burial ground,
          with it's pictish stone, visited. A try was made to find out
          how <a href="IMG_0341_edited.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Buth-dhible</a> (Off licence in Gaelic if you must know :-) is
          pronounced.</p>

        <p>Friday (8/9) started in <a href="IMG_0365.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Inverewe Gardens</a> (a well known garden that
          has <a href="IMG_0376.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">palm trees</a> and more as the Gulf Stream passes the coast).
          There were a lot of crazy people with <a href="IMG_0381.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">blue hats</a> that seemed to
          extend all the way down to their shoulders. :-) Lunch was eaten
          at Poolewe Hotel (<a href="IMG_0453.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">with some furry guests</a>)
          before heading for Inverasdale, yet <a href="IMG_0457.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">another
          beach</a> to be painted (and once again by the older generation).
          (I wonder if <a href="IMG_0460.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Friday</a> had been there? :-)
          A small point was climbed by the male part of the party to make
          sense of the <a href="IMG_0483.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">geography</a>. Looking at west Scotland from the sea
          (or from a beach on other side of water in this case) is very confusing. It is
          a fact that has worked in Scotland's favor when foreign navies
          have tried attacking (except the vikings). Most of this week's
          travels have been done on single track roads with sheep on them.</p>

        <p>Saturday (9/9) and it's <a href="IMG_0519.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">cleaning day</a>.
          :-( The day turned out to be the <a href="IMG_0523.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">best</a>
          so far, as the weather goes, this September. It turned to worse
          in the <a href="IMG_0526.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">evening</a> though. (Bonus for people I meet later:
          ask me to show the film with the bagpiper. :-)</p>

        <h3>Gairloch to Ullapool</h3>
        <p>The old generation has gone back to Cupar (via Lochearnhead and
          Stirling). For me it's time to move on north. I had planned to
          go to <a href="IMG_0551.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Ullapool</a> (where my mobile phone works! - it hasn't for
          the last week), but I ended up in Ardmair on the sunday (10/9)
          with <a href="IMG_0534.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">a view</a> of the
          <a href="IMG_0588.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">ferries</a> 
          from Stornoway. Ullapool was <a href="IMG_0562.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">toured</a> in the afternoon
          and there I got to see a live <a href="IMG_0566.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">seal</a> <b>in the harbour</b>. They
          seem to know that <a href="IMG_0571.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">fishing boats contain fish</a>...</p>

        <p>The monday (11/9) afternoon was spent visiting Achiltibuie, Lochinver,
          and Ardvreck Castle. I left the main road at Drumrunie to drive
          the 15 miles (24 km) <a href="IMG_0596.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">single track roads</a>
          along moores and peat bogs to <a href="IMG_0613.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Achiltibuie</a>,
          where I hade tea at Summer Island Hotel (?). Found a <a href="IMG_0617.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">nice house</a>
          on the beach with lovely windows. The view from <a href="IMG_0619.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Altandhu</a>
          was very nice. Doubling back a bit, along <a href="IMG_0635.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">peat bogs</a>
          (where they still extract peat from), I turned
          north towards Lochinver on roads that kept you <a href="IMG_0647.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">busy as a driver</a>.
          The closer one got to Lochinver the more winding the roads
          became - often <a href="IMG_0649.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">a ledge</a> with a small wall towards the water and a cliff on the
          other side. I missed the Knockan Crag geological
          visiting center, but got to see some <a href="IMG_0664.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">great rocks</a>.
          I also missed a closer look at <a href="IMG_0655.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Ardvreck Castle</a>, Calda
          House, and nearby church (with information about castle and house).
          The latter as the midges where attacking and the former as it
          took longer driving from Achiltibuie to Lochinver than I had thought.</p>

        <h3>Ullapool to Dornoch</h3>
        <p>A bit tired of midges (and sad to say also the west coast) I
          went to the east coast on the tuesday (12/9). On the way I
          stopped at <a href="IMG_0689.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Corrieshalloch Gorge</a> with
          a <a href="IMG_0679.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">suspension brige</a> over the
          deep gorge. Arriving in Dornoch I found a nice
          campsite in Pitgrudy <a href="IMG_0756.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">overlooking</a> the Dornoch Firth and made
          a quick tour of Dornoch. The <a href="IMG_0704.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">old castle</a>,
          next to the <a href="IMG_0706.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">cathedral</a>
          is now a hotel and there where quite a few nice house, some
          along the <a href="IMG_0739.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Dornoch Burn</a>. As a train freak, and finding names like Station
          Road, I had to visit the old railway station, now a take away.</p>

        <p>Wednesday (13/9) was spent taking it easy... But it was
          quite a windy day so I had to 'hit the beach' to look at the
          <a href="IMG_0771.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">waves</a>. :-) And as usual I had to do things different from others
          - I did the historic walk of Dornoch backwards.</p>

        <p>Plans for thursday (14/9) was to go north to Thurso and Wick visiting,
          amoung other things, a broch (a stoneage round house and defense
          tower), castles, (rock) stacks, and John O'Groats. It turned
          out to be a very rainy day so I 'only' got to have lunch in
          Golspie, visit <a href="IMG_0833.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Sleeperzzz</a> [<a href="http://Sleeperzzz.com/" 
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit website</a>] at
          Rogart station, and visit some people from the past (the Quinns) in
          Lairg. In Lairg I got to meet the Broons and see <a href="IMG_0842.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">their house</a>
          (But 'n' Ben). On the way back I stopped at <a href="IMG_0853.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="september1">Shin Falls</a>,
          which where 'nothing' after I had seen Falls of Measach (OK, I
          never got a good photo of the whole water fall).</p>
