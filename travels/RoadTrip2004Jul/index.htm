        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In July of 2004 I bought a tent and took a trip north in Sweden,
          west out on the Lofoten islands, and then south through Norway
          (well, at least to Mo i Rana where I got bored with the 'quality'
          of Norwegian roads). From there I entered Sweden, went south to
          Strömstad, then north to Oslo, and then home. Altogether I took
          approximately 860 pictures during the two weeks I was travelling.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        <h2>North through Sweden</h2>
        <h3>Eskilstuna to Gävle</h3>
        <p>I started of by visiting Gävle and it's railway museum (i.e. a lot of the pictures are
          of trains and related things). Visiting the museum has been a dream for many
          years as I like trains (my grandfather worked for the railway and I have lived
          my first 20-25 years by the West Coast Railway in Sweden). But
          before visiting the museum I had an
          Indian meal on the <a href="Gavle/P7030542.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">beach</a> outside
          Furuvik where I spent the night.
          :-) After the museum I also got to see the <a href="Gavle/P7040588.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">castle</a>
          (if one likes calling these
          kinds of buildings for castles - Örebro castle is what I call a
          castle :-) and the county jail (now a museum and
          workshop thingamy). Being a Brynäs fan (ice hockey team of Gävle), I had to have
          a photo of the <a href="Gavle/P7040594.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">ice rink</a>. :-)</p>
         
        <h3>Gävle to Hudiksvall</h3>
        <p>From Gävle I went on to Hudiksvall - a nice small town. Most interesting is
          the <a href="Hudiksvall/P7040616.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">fishing &quot;huts&quot;</a>
          along the canal running through town.
          Here I got to photograph <a href="Hudiksvall/P7040597.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">a man
            wearing a provincal dress</a> (Delsbo dress). (More
          pictures of trains and railway related things. :-)</p>

        <h3>Hudiksvall to Härnösand</h3>
        <p>Next I followed the coast up to Härnösand, also a nice small town. Although a
          bit boring (according to me :-) but had a great outdoor museum
          with <a href="Harnosand/P7050665.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">old houses</a>. I also went to
          see the <a href="Harnosand/P7050682.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">High Coast Bridge</a>,
          <a href="Harnosand/P7050696.JPG">Ådalen</a> where 5 people
          where shot by military while demostrating (monument raised in their honour) and
          the <a href="Harnosand/P7050700.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">old bridge</a> across the Ångermanland
          River. I didn't find anything to take a photo of in Kramfors (the 10 minutes I
          was there, i.e. I didn't give the town much of a chance).</p>

        <h3>Härnösand to Örnsköldsvik</h3>
        <p>The next part of the trip lead me over the High Coast Bridge
          and through &quot;The High Coast&quot; (Höga kusten) - the highest maritime coastal line in
          Sweden. That is where the ground has risen since the ice age (up to 285 meters
          above the sea). This is one of the parts of Sweden I now find
          <a href="Hogakusten/P7060714.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">most beautiful</a> since I drove along
          the &quot;tourist road&quot; (from the bridge to Ullånger). After that I rode a
          <a href="Hogakusten/P7060725.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">ski lift</a> to the highest point -
          <a href="Hogakusten/P7060741.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Skuleberget</a>. The
          <a href="Hogakusten/P7060726.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">view from Skuleberget</a> is breathtaking.</p>

        <p>After The High Coast I stopped of in Örnsköldsvik. They have a museum (Gene fornby) where they have built
          <a href="Ornskoldsvik/P7060743.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">replicas of
            stoneage</a> (?) huts from a nearby excavation. The
          <a href="Ornskoldsvik/P7060755.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">town centre</a> has older houses but
          otherwise it seemed a bit boring (yet again according to me).</p>

          <h3>Örnsköldsvik to Skellefteå</h3>
        <p>As my car needed service, and the only ones prepared to do it
          the same week where in Skellefteå, I ended up
          there for two nights (a place I had thought of skipping). But finally I came to a town with some
          &quot;visible&quot; history -
          among other things an <a href="Skelleftea/P7080781.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">outdoor museum</a> (where I met a nice
          <a href="Skelleftea/P7080777.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">elderly couple</a> who told
          me the story of a house) and the old &quot;<a href="Skelleftea/P7080794.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">church town</a>&quot; (Bondstan).
          A church town
          consists of small houses where people from outside town could stay while
          attending church services. These church towns where common in the north where
          distances are far. They also have one of the <a href="Skelleftea/P7080804.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">longest wooden bridges</a> stil
          in use.
          A managed a quick visit to Skellefteå hamn when my car was serviced (more train related pictures, among
          others a sighting of a train, TGOJ litt. Ma, from my part of Sweden).</p>

        <h3>Skellefteå to Burträsk</h3>
        <p>While in Skellefteå I found out about a music festival in Burträsk, my 
          next stop. In <a href="Burtrask/P7090826.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Burträsk</a> I almost got
          eaten alive by mosquitoes, but I got to wear my kilt and listen to the music. At
          the festival I met a Scottish woman and her Swedish husband, a Canadian woman
          visiting her Swedish husbands family, and some other northern young people. I
          took some &quot;<a href="Burtrask/P7100828.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">after-midnight-pictures</a>&quot; showing
          <a href="Burtrask/P7100829.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">camp site</a> looking mystical. :-)</p>

        <h3>Burträsk to Arvidsjaur</h3>
        <p>Next day I went on to Sorsele to see the
          <a href="Sorsele/P7100838.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">museum</a> (in the railway station) for 
          the Inland Railway (Inlandsbanan) -
          nothing else caught my
          interest so I went on to Arvidsjaur.</p>

        <h3>Arvidsjaur to Jokkmokk</h3>
        <p>In Arvidsjaur I got
          a great view of the <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7100846.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">surroundings</a> and got to ride on a
          <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7100856.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">steam train</a> to
          <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7100860.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Slagnäs</a>. On the way back to Arvidsjaur we stopped on
          the <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7100868.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">middle of the line</a> (engine leaving us
          alone for a while) and those who wanted had a swim in the lake (<A
            HREF="Arvidsjaur/P7100871.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Nastajaure</a>) before
          grilling some sausages. Before leaving Arvidsjaur I got a look at the Lapp
          (Same) <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7110891.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">church town</a> (Lappstan). Pushing on I looked at
          <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7110912.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Kåbdalis</a> (place of opening of the Inland
          Railway) and <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7110914.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Kitajaur</a>. In
          Kitajaur a danish lady runs a cafe in the old railway station. Next stop was the
          <a href="Arvidsjaur/P7110923.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">polar circle</a> (in Sweden).</p>

        <p>Next night was spent in Jokkmokk. A small but great town with a Lapp museum. North of Jokkmokk is a
          <a href="Jokkmokk/P7120944.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">hydro
            power station</a> with Lapp paintings on (done by a &quot;Swede&quot; and aggravating the
          Lapps, for good reason). Further north the hydro power station seems to be everywhere. One was
          built at the <a href="Jokkmokk/P7120963.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Hare's Leap</a> (Harsprånget), where the river bends like a hare
          leaping (tranquil when no water is released). North of the dam was a town built for the workers that built the
          dam
          (and another one just south of town). The town was torn down but now they have
          put up <a href="Jokkmokk/P7120977.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">signs</a> showing where different houses where (like a ghost town
          without
          houses :-). In Porjus one can find one of the most
          <a href="Jokkmokk/P7120988.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">luxurious control rooms</a> for
          the old hydro power station - built in marble!</p>

        <h3>Jokkmokk to Kiruna</h3>
        <p>From Jokkmokk I went to Gällivare and Malmberget where iron ore is mined (and my meeting with
          my first <a href="Gallivare-Malmberget/P7121004.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">iron ore train</a>).
          Gällivare being the terminus for the Inland Railway and a station on the Iron
          Ore Railway (Malmbana). And Malmberget being the town with the
          <a href="Gallivare-Malmberget/P7121017.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">mines</a>. In Malmberget they have
          rebuilt a <a href="Gallivare-Malmberget/P7121020.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">shanty town</a> from old
          photos and they have great ideas for <a href="Gallivare-Malmberget/P7121036.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">
            letter boxes</a>. :-) I went on to spend the night in Kiruna.</p>

        <p>Kiruna is yet another town where iron ore
          is being mined (and thereby more <a href="Kiruna/P7120015.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">iron ore trains</a>
          :-). Wherever you go in Kiruna (just about) you see one or more of the
          mines or something relating to the mines (like houses with
          <a href="Kiruna/P7120024.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">balconies</a> looking like mine elevators). The
          <a href="Kiruna/P7120030.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">church</a> has an interesting desing and the
          <a href="Kiruna/P7120057.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">town hall</a> has won prizes. In Kiruna I met a
          Welsh couple who where nice enough to give me some ointment for my mosquito
          bites. Thank you! :-) What I didn't enjoy with Kiruna is that I got a cold here,
          or rather I started coughing here (i.e. I must have picked it up before Kiruna -
          I'm not blaming Kiruna for that :-). (A good advice is to fill up with petrol
          here if continuing into Norway - cheaper than in Norway.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-2">
        <h2>... and into north of Norway</h2>
        <h3>Kiruna to Stokmarknes</h3>
        <p>Next I went through Abisko (it was too cloudy to ride the ski
          lift for a view) and Riksgränsen (border to Norway)
          and onto the islands of Lofoten. Interesting
          enough, the nature changes as one passes into Norway - things seem to get
          <a href="Lofoten/P7130080.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">softer and greener</a>. On the way out I
          drove on the <a href="Lofoten/P7130086.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">main road</a> (E10, from Kiruna to Å)
          - a road that follows the water and mountains, i.e. is not very straight. The
          nature was magnificent, especially the <a href="Lofoten/P7130100.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">turquoise waters</a>, 
          but the roads
          where quite narrow at times.
          I stopped at a <a href="Lofoten/P7140105.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">camp site</a> (my light coloured
          tent to the right) in Stokmarknes for the night looking up the
          <a href="Lofoten/P7140104.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">mountains</a>.</p>

        <h3>Stokmarknes to Svolvaer, via Å</h3>
        <p>The next day I went on south to take the ferry from Melbu to
          Fiskeboe. An interesting observeration is that nature seems to change when one
          leaves on island arriving on <a href="Lofoten/P7140132.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">another island</a>.
          And sometimes it feels stupid to drive around a bay for half an hour only to see
          <a href="Lofoten/P7140150.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">the other side</a> which one just drove down...
          The fishing villages are quite quaint with their <a href="Lofoten/P7140167.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">
            houses built on poles</a> - some <a href="Lofoten/P7140185.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">for rent</a>.
          The <a href="Lofoten/P7140196.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">roads</a> didn't get
          any better the further west one gets (some of the
          photos where taking through my windshield - no where to stop to take the photos!)
          Some places reminded me of Scotland, like <a href="Lofoten/P7140217.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">a beach</a>
          with a small church nearby and sheep running around on round green hills with
          rock sticking up. I stopped of at <a href="Lofoten/P7140222.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Bruslanda Camping</a>
          (my tent to the left with the tide coming in) and got some good photos of
          <a href="Lofoten/P7140234.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">mountains reflecting</a>
          in the water. On the way back I took a ferry from Svolvaer to Skutvik (on the main land) -
          during the trip at sea we got to see <a href="Lofoten/P7150251.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">killer whales</a>!</p>

        <h3>Svolvaer to Tärnaby</h3>
        <p>From Skutvik I went south through northern Norway until I passed the <a href="NordNorge/P7150289.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">polar circle</a> (in Norway) before
          heading for Swedish roads (which are &quot;faster&quot; than the Norwegian ones).
          I got to see people living in the <a href="NordNorge/P7150284.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">middle of
            nowhere</a> and the <a href="NordNorge/P7150288.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">Black Ice</a>
          (Svartisen) - glacier ice.</p>

        <h2>... and back into Sweden</h2>
        <h3>Tärnaby to Karlstad</h3>
        <p>Back in Sweden I spent the night in Klippen north of Tärnaby (where Ingemar Stenmark and Anja
          Pärson comes from) and watched <a href="Tarnaby-Vilhelmina/P7150292.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">snowy
            mountains</a> in the sundown at half past ten. Tärnaby seems to be a nice (if
          slightly boring, i.e. nothing happening at times) town to live in. I stopped of in Vilhelmina, and it's
          <a href="Tarnaby-Vilhelmina/P7160296.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">church town</a>, picked up a
          hitch-hiker (from Örnsköldsvik! :-) in Sveg and dropped him off in Karlstad (where
          I spent the night).</p>

          <h3>Karlstad to Strömstad</h3>
        <p>From Karlstad I went to Strömstad, on the Swedish west coast to meet my colleague from work and her family.
          There we saw Saltön (F.Y.I. where a director from Volvo lives with his new Volvo
          cars :-) - a place where kids can &quot;<a href="Stromstad/P7170301.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="roadtrip04">play on the
