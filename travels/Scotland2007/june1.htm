        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the middle of April 2007 I drove down to Esbjerg, Denmark,
          to catch the ferry to Harwich (as the Gothenburg-Newcastle ferry
          not longer sails) and then north into Scotland (with my 'new'
          caravan, a Cabby 532 DLX, also from 1987, if you must know :-).</p>
        <p>This trip has been split into five parts: April, May parts 1 and 2, and
          June parts 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>In this first part, I travelled from Eskilstuna to Esbjerg to catch
          ferry to Harwich, and then headed up to Lake Distict before heading along
          Scotland's Southwest coast.
        </p>

        <h2>June, part 1</h2>

        <h3>Fife to Fordoun (continued)</h3>

        <p>Friday (1/6) and I headed up Drumtochty Glen, with an interesting
          <a href="IMG_4275.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">church</a>, 
          to <a href="IMG_4288.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Cairn
          O'Mount</a> and Banchory. South of Banchory is <a href="IMG_4295.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Falls
          of Heugh</a>, where jumping salmons can be seen. Countinued to Millton
          of Crathes to look at <a href="IMG_4308.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Royal Deeside Railway</a>,
          which I thought would be a commercial attempt at reviving the
          railway, but alas not... Headed south to Stonehaven, for a trip
          down memory lane, and to get a look at <a href="IMG_4322.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Dunnottar
          Castle</a> in the sun (although the haar, or mist, was rolling
          in). Stopped off to look at <a href="IMG_4343.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Catterline</a>
          and it's harbour. (Did some shopping in Inverbervie where, ironically,
          the builder of Cutty Sark, that burnt the week before, was born.)</p>

        <p>Saturday (2/6) started of rainy... Used the afternoon to look
          for, and learn more about, some more recent history from WWII.
          (Learnt that I was staying on an old airfield where Polish
          pilots stayed and not far from a internment camp for Italians.)</p>

        <h3>Fordoun to Alford</h3>

        <p>Sunday (3/6) and time to head north again. This time to Alford
          where <a href="IMG_4348.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Alford Valley Railway</a> (including
          it's museum) and Grampian Transport Museum is located.<br>
          (The camp site in Alford is interesting as it's reception is in
          Haughton House, a massive building. And maybe I'll stop by Billy
          Connolly's place as well. :-)</p>

        <p>Monday (4/6) and time for some touring in the country side to look
          for castles and old monuments. Headed for <a href="IMG_4352.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Corgaff
          Castle</a>, another castle I felt I just had to see (as I did
          Hermitage Castle). Up the hill is a great <a href="IMG_4364.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">modern
          monument</a> with 'viewing holes'. Heading back again in <a href="IMG_4371.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Doune
          of Invernochty</a>, a motte (mound) that's been used for a castle, a
          church, and a observation point during WWII (and cold war). (No
          sign of Billy... but I might have seen him on his trike...:-)
          After that I found that <a href="IMG_4380.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">I was lost</a>...
          or was it the <a href="IMG_4379.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">recording site of Lost</a>?...
          :-) Next castle was <a href="IMG_4381.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Glenbuchat Castle</a>,
          a Z-plan castle.<br>
          (A Z-plan castle has a main building, usually with a main hall
          on the first floor, with towers on opposite corners, for defence,
          which makes it look like a Z from above.<br>
          And Billy, or Billy Connolly, is a pretty famous comedian that
          nowadays live around Strathdon, at least according to what I have
          been told. :-)</p>

        <p>Tuesday (5/6) and yet more castles and monuments to see. First
          on the list was <a href="IMG_4394.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Culsh Earth-House</a>,
          used for storage and not living. On the way to <a href="IMG_4408.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Kildrummy
          Castle</a>, with an impressive defensive design, River Don was
          <a href="IMG_4401.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">crossed</a> 
          a few times. <a href="IMG_4449.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Balvenie
          Castle</a>, in Dufftown, on the other hand seems to have been designed more
          for comfort. Next to the castle is <a href="IMG_4476.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Glenfiddish
          Distillery</a> and not far off <a href="IMG_4478.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">station</a>
          of Keith and Dufftown Railway. At the station I found two <a href="IMG_4490.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Pullman
          coaches</a> and in town a whisky museum and '<a href="IMG_4502.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">The
          Flower Express</a>'. :-) On the way back I had a quick look at
          <a href="IMG_4506.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Huntly Castle</a>.</p>

        <h3>Alford to Aviemore/Aberfeldy</h3>

        <p>(6/6) Time to head to the whisky district... or 'old hunting grounds'...
          or 'holiday adventure district'. I aimed for Aberlour, then
          Grantown-on-Spey, but ended up in Aviemore. After Aberlour the
          sun came out and it was a very pleasant drive, during which I
          had lunch at a layby overlooking <a href="IMG_4518.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">River
          Spey and the Cairngorms</a>. Had a look at <a href="IMG_4527.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Boat
          of Garten station</a>, where they where preparing for 'a special',
          and the <a href="IMG_4535.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">bridge</a> at Carrbridge.
          The <a href="IMG_4541.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Cairngorms</a> are nice at sundown.</p>

        <p>Aviemore being a bit pricy I decided (7/6) to continue south
          but ended up in yet another pricy place: Aberfeldy. The drive
          was done via <a href="IMG_4542.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Ruthven barracks</a> (outside
          Kingussie), which is at a confluence of via <a href="IMG_4572.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">roads</a>
          through the mountains, and Drumochter Pass. Visited Scottish
          <a href="IMG_4591.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Crannog</a> Centre on Loch Tay
          before heading north, where I found an old <a href="IMG_4594.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">lime
          kiln</a>. Continued to <a href="IMG_4610.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Loch Rannoch</a>,
          under the supervision of <a href="IMG_4605.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Schiehallion</a>,
          and then east to <a href="IMG_4620.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Queen's View</a> on Loch
          Tummel, during which time Schiehallion decided to 'hide'. :-)<br>
          (A crannog is an stone/iron age [?] wood structure building built in
          a loch, most likely for defence against wild animals. A replica
          of a crannog has been built at the Crannog Centre as an experiment.
          Inside the crannog, between two benches for the visitor, a duck
          was nesting, visibly undisturbed of all human visitors. :-)</p>

        <p>Time (8/6) for a tour south. It started in <a href="IMG_4662.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Dunkeld</a>,
          with it's <a href="IMG_4636.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">old cathedral</a> (part of which
          is now used as a parrish church) and <a href="IMG_4655.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">bridge</a>,
          in which the north end contains the old jail. Dunkeld wasn't
          anything like I remember it... but then on the other hand we
          mostly passed through when A9 went through. Next was <a href="IMG_4670.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Huntingtower
          Castle</a>, which I believe I've been to before, only I don't
          remember the '<a href="IMG_4683.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">bridge</a>' was a staircase...
          I had planned for some roman history, but couldn't find the signs to
          the signal towers. Auchterarder was given a miss, but now I can
          say I've been to <a href="IMG_4700.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Gleneagles</a>. :-) So
          next I headed north (and missed one church?) to <a href="IMG_4702.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Muthill
          church</a> - not all that exiting but still some different architecture,
          amoung other things the towers base being inside the church.
          Crieff was not quite what I had expected, but still what I expected...
          Amalree, between Crieff and Aberfeldy, is nicely situated at the
          entrance of a glen. The <a href="IMG_4707.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Watermill</a> in
          Aberfeldy looks nice as does <a href="IMG_4716.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">General Wade's
          Bridge</a> over River Tay. The <a href="IMG_4726.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Blach Watch
          Monument</a> is situated on the opposite side of River Tay from
          where the, what was to become, the Black Watch gathered the first
          time.<br>
          (For those that have missed it Gleneagles is a famous golf course...<br>
          Huntingtower Castle was originally a simple towerhouse that was
          'extended' by another detached towerhouse. The two towers where
          connected by an 'extension' at a  later date. As the floors where
          built by wood that has rotten away, they are now connected via
          a 'bridge'.<br>
          General Wade was tasked with building a road network, with bridges,
          across Scotland to make it easier to move troops. This, and the
          building of forts like Fort William and barracks like those in
          Ruthven, was done to control the Scots. The Black Watch originally
          contained only local men, i.e. a form of militia.)</p>

        <p>Sun beaming down (9/6) I decided to head up <a href="IMG_4761.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Glen
          Lyon</a>, which was nice (at least halfway up the Glen). Started
          up at Fortingall Church and the <a href="IMG_4733.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">5000 year
          old yew tree</a>. Bought lunch at Bridge of Balgie and ate it
          overlooking all the green fields with sheep up the glen. Turned
          back and headed south from Bridge of Balgie and up another glen,
          which was even more impressive (and with more narrow road) as
          was Ben Lawer. Stopped at Kenmore and looked at the bridge, village,
          <a href="IMG_4780.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">church</a>,
          <a href="IMG_4791.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Taymouth
          Castle</a>, now on the grounds of the golf course, and the view
          of <a href="IMG_4789.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Loch Tay</a>. 
          Went on to see <a href="IMG_4804.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">St.
          Mary's Chapel</a>, with <a href="IMG_4795.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">painted ceiling</a>,
          and churchyard, the old chapel of Grandtully before the laird
          (?) built a new church elsewhere.</p>

        <h3>Aberfeldy to Fife (again)</h3>

        <p>Time for (10-13/6) a last visit to Fife (Lower Largo) before heading
          south to England and the ferry...:-(</p>

        <h3>Fife to England</h3>

        <p>First stop was Lockerbie (13/6), about a three hour drive (i.e.
          long enough) and near enough to <a href="IMG_4811.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">Caerlaverock
          Castle</a> (which I missed before). It <b>was</b> worth the visit
          - the castle looked as I expected on the outside but <a href="IMG_4860.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">inside</a>
          was a pleasent suprise! Heading back I stopped off in Lockerbie
          and had a look at (the back of) their <a href="IMG_4897.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june1">townhall</a>
          (?), otherwise not much to report (except that the 'best pizza
          place' made a pretty good pizza, but not as good as the Italian
          in Aviemore). The Garden of Rembrance, commemorating the Lockerbie
          aircrash, is a sad place where I learnt that there was Swedes
          onboard...<br>
          (For those that don't know Brittish geography: Lockerbie is in
          Scotland, i.e. I haven't left Scotland yet. :-)</p>

        <p>Continued in June, part 2</p>
