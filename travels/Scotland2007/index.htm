        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the middle of April 2007 I drove down to Esbjerg, Denmark,
          to catch the ferry to Harwich (as the Gothenburg-Newcastle ferry
          not longer sails) and then north into Scotland (with my 'new'
          caravan, a Cabby 532 DLX, also from 1987, if you must know :-).</p>
        <p>This trip has been split into five parts: April, May parts 1 and 2, and
          June parts 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>In this first part, I travelled from Eskilstuna to Esbjerg to catch
          ferry to Harwich, and then headed up to Lake Distict before heading along
          Scotland's Southwest coast.
        </p>

        <h2>April</h2>

        <h3>The 'Crossing'</h3>
        <p>Crossing Denmark also meant crossing 'the three bridges': &Ouml;resund,
          and Big and Little Belt (the two first ones are toll bridges, which
          cost me about 1000 SEK in total). The North Sea was a bit rough to start with... and
          a bit <a href="IMG_2293.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">lonely</a> (as last year). Luckly I
          had the '<a href="IMG_2288.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">people</a>' to say goodbye in
          Esbjerg ('Humans and the sea'). :-) As always, the world is a small
          one: I met my old classmate's (Tina's) parents on their way to
          see her in Wales. (Rumour has it that the owner of the men's wear
          shop in BÃ¥stad was on the boat as well. :-)</p>

        <h3>Harwich to Boston</h3>
        <p>From Harwich (Friday 20th) I drove to Boston (UK, not bl**dy USA
          :-) to spend a night or two there. This drive taught me that it's
          a good idea to buy a map and study it (took a detour via Cambridge)
          and that The Fens really are flat. :-)<br>
          (The Fens is coastal marshland that has been drained to create,
          or reclaim, agricultural land, a
          practice that has been quite common in southern England. In some
          cases banks have also been built to reclaim land from the sea,
          even as late as 1982, and to protect the lowlands from flooding
          of the sea.)</p>

        <p>Saturday (21/4) was used to tour <a href="IMG_2299.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Boston</a>
          and it's market, which was busy. Boston has an old <a href="IMG_2312.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">wind
          mill</a> that was used until 1946 when it broke. It is now
          restored and fully functional. The beaches east of Boston was
          once a resort, where horse races took place, before they silted
          up. Nowadays they are good for birdwatching and people go
          to Skegness instead, with it's <a href="IMG_2314.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">attractions</a>,
          when they want to 'hit the beach'. (Obviously it's not a town that
          <a href="IMG_2321.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">appreciates art</a>. :-) Personally I like
          Northumberland's beaches (north of Newcastle) better with their
          sand dunes (see last days of <a href="../Scotland2006/october.htm">Scotland
          2006</a>).</p>

        <h3>Boston to Lake District</h3>
        <p>From Boston I went (22/4) on to Lake District (and the rain)
          for a few nights. I thougt I took the low route through the Pennines,
          but it turned out not to be the case. The West Yorkshire hills
          are quite amazing and remind me of the Highlands (in Scotland).
          In the evening I managed to squeeze in a quick
          tour of eastern Lake District with a visit to <a href="IMG_2325.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Ullswater</a>.<br>
          (The Pennines are a range of hills running through the north of
          England from north to south. They have, in other words, been a
          hinder when travelling, or transporting goods, from east to west.)</p>

        <p>On Monday (23/4) I went looking for a cheaper campsite (still
          in the rain), which doesn't seem to be easy in these parts. I
          did feel sorry for leaving '<a href="IMG_2331.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">my mate</a>',
          but Appleby turned out to be a more pleasant place to be. :-)
          (... partly being next to the Carlisle-Settle railway line :-).
          Driving south (from Appleby) along a country road I got to see sudden
          landscape changes, from wooded farm land to <a href="IMG_2332.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">windsweept
          moores</a> and back to green farm land again. I also learnt that
          Melrose Place is in Kendal, not Hollywood, and Pitlochry in
          Lakeland. :-) Kendal has a nice town centre and is also the end
          of the Lancashire canal (now filled in in Kendal). From Kendal
          I went to a very rainy Windermere, <a href="IMG_2337.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Bowness
          on Windermere</a>, and Keswick.<br>
          On the way back I stopped in Penrith, another nice town centre
          with an interesting chuch: <a href="IMG_2340.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">St. Andrew's</a>
          with '<a href="IMG_2344.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">the giant's grave</a>'. There is
          not much left of the Penrith's castle, and most of it's ground has been
          turned into recreation grounds (tennis, et.c.). At Appleby's
          railway station, where Right Reverend E. Treacy died in 1978, I
          found a heritage centre that restores old railway coaches and
          trains. I also got to see the <a href="IMG_2365.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">old ford</a>
          and castle mill. Passing through the town centre (again) I realized that
          this is the Appleby (in Westmoreland) where Time Time dug up the
          yard of the police station. :-)</p>

        <p>Tuesday (24/4) saw slightly better weather (not constantly raining)
          and was used to tour Appleby a bit closer. Appleby is a quaint
          little town with the <a href="IMG_2368.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">castle</a> (sorry,
          closed since 2004) at the top of the main street and a <a href="IMG_2371.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">church</a>
          at the bottom. I find the churches in this area interesting as
          they are low and flat, i.e. no raised roofs. I got a closer look
          at the <a href="IMG_2376.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">police station</a> and then moved
          on to Brough and it's <a href="IMG_2383.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">castle</a>. I met
          two men at Brough's <a href="IMG_2408.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">church</a> that told
          me that the floor slopes towards the altar. (They made a joke
          about it being so that the 'the bride could walk down the aisle'.
          :-) As it was a bit grey I ordered a curry and went back to my
          caravan to enjoy it. (The trainspotter in me made me take a walk
          down to the railway line... and there I was, and a train came
          along. :-)</p>

        <h3>Lake District to Annan</h3>
        <p>Annan is a wee town just west of Gretna (where I stayed last year).
          My move (25/4) to Scotland seems to have made the weather turn for the
          better, as did the <a href="IMG_2419.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">view</a> from the camp
          site. :-) Had a wee look at Annan before heading back to my caravan
          for yesterday's curry and some domestic work.</p>

        <p>Another fine day (26/4) for me (and '<a href="IMG_2422.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">my mates</a>')
          - time for a trip to Dumfries, which didn't excite me very much...
          But what (a few days later) annoys me is that I missed looking
          at Caerlaverock Castle... :-( Another early evening to do some
          more domestic work.</p>

        <p>Finding the area around Annan a bit agricultural (i.e. a bit
          boring), I decided to go back (27/4) to England for some roman history...
          or so I thought. I ended up looking at more modern history, like
          <a href="IMG_2437.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">The Citadel</a> (or Court Houses) - a modern
          reconstruction of the originals from the 16th century. I also saw
          the <a href="IMG_2443.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">cathedral</a> and (front of) the
          <a href="IMG_2455.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">castle</a>. Yet more domestic work to be
          done...</p>

        <p>Hermitage castle has always fasinated me since I first saw a
          photo of it. So I decided to head that way (28/4). I started of
          at Liddesdale Heritage Centre in <a href="IMG_2464.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Newcastleton</a>,
          where I gather the older generation becomes nostalgic over all
          the old things. <a href="IMG_2473.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Hermitage castle</a> was
          as fascinating as I thought, especially as it's in the middle of
          nowhere - just sheep to keep it company. Continuing north I found
          an <a href="IMG_2492.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">old railway viaduct</a> of the Waverly
          line (Edinburgh-Carlisle line) and the sign to Riccarton Junction
          (which I will have to come back to at a later time, it being 3
          miles from the road). At Hawick, that didn't excite me, I turned
          south again (meeting up with the old Waverly line every now and
          then).<br>
          (Newcastleton is a planned village, i.e. it's layout is very
          straight, usually with a main street with shops and one or more
          squares, and streets running of it. Planned villages became quite
          common in the beginning of industrialization.<br>
          In the 1960s a lot of Britain's railways where abandoned, leaving
          a lot of stone bridges and viaducts still standing in the middle
          of nowhere. An interesting thing about Riccarton Junction is that
          there where no roads leading to it - one had to take the train
          there. It's been a 'ghost village' for many years, but now somebody
          is trying to rebuild it...)</p>

        <p>Sunday (29/4) and one last day at Annan - time for a tour of
          Solway coast. First stop was <a href="IMG_2501.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Sweetheart
          Abbey</a> and the corn mill in New Abbey (where I found <a href="IMG_2502.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">a
          collection</a> that makes somebody's milk bottle collection look
          puny :-). Visited <a href="IMG_2517.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">MacLellan's Castle</a>
          in Kirkudbright (a place that seems more appropriate in Balamory,
          but otherwise nice :-). Made a quick tour of Castle Douglas and
          Dalbeattie on the way back...<br>
          (Sweetheart Abbey is so called as the founder, Lady of Galloway,
          was buried there with her husband's, John Balliol's, embalmed
          heart.<br>
          Balamory is a children's TV series based on the village of Tobermory,
          where the houses are painted in different bright colours.)</p>

        <h3>Annan to Glenluce</h3>
        <p>Monday (30/4) and time to move further west: Glenluce. I set up my caravan and
          retraced my steps to Gatehouse of Fleet. On the way I stopped
          for tea in Newton Stewart, a busy small village, and Creetown.
          At Gatehouse of Fleet I joined Historic Scotland as to gain free
          entry to <a href="IMG_2574.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Cardoness Castle</a>, a tower
          house, and other historic sites. I also had a fish and chips from
          the Codfather and met a <a href="IMG_2595.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">birdspotter</a>.
          :-) On the way back I visited the <a href="IMG_2605.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">carins</a>
          at Cairnholy and <a href="IMG_2624.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="april">Carsluith's Castle</a>.</p>
