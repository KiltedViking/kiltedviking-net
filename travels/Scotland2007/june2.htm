        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the middle of April 2007 I drove down to Esbjerg, Denmark,
          to catch the ferry to Harwich (as the Gothenburg-Newcastle ferry
          not longer sails) and then north into Scotland (with my 'new'
          caravan, a Cabby 532 DLX, also from 1987, if you must know :-).</p>
        <p>This trip has been split into five parts: April, May parts 1 and 2, and
          June parts 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>In this first part, I travelled from Eskilstuna to Esbjerg to catch
          ferry to Harwich, and then headed up to Lake Distict before heading along
          Scotland's Southwest coast.
        </p>

        <h2>June, part 2</h2>

        <h3>England</h3>

        <p>Time (14/6) to cross the border and Skipton seemed far enough.
          Had a look at the <a href="IMG_4903.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">basin</a> on Leeds and
          Liverpool Canal, the town, and castle gate.<br>
          (I didn't know that the kiwis had started a <a href="IMG_4902_EDITED.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">transportation
          serive</a> before they left. :-) <span class="instructions">(Please
          note that it was pouring down and the lorry overtook me, quite
          fast, on the motorway... So I had to whip out my camera, point,
          and shoot through the windscreen, and winscreen wipers, quickly.)</span></p>

        <p>Fridag (15/6) and time to have a look at the <a href="IMG_4923.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Yorkshire
          Dales</a> and I headed for a wet Grassington. The day turned out
          to be a day of trains with an old level crossing at Cracoe and
          visit to both stations of Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway.
          The afternoon turned out less wet and I took a walk along <a href="IMG_4936.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Leeds
          and Liverpool Canal</a>, that runs behind the camp site at Gargrave.</p>

        <p>Saturday (16/6) and time for some more industrial history. Started
          of at <a href="IMG_4979.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Earby's Lead Mining Museum</a> (where
          I met a very nice couple) which is <b>very</b> interesting. Next
          I headed for <a href="IMG_4982.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Bancroft Mill Engine</a> in
          Barnoldswick, which runs about every third Sunday during the summer.
          Made a quick visit to the marina before leaving and did a slight
          detour to Burnley on the way back (which was a misstake) before
          heading for Silsden.</p>

        <p>Sunday (17/6) and I headed further east and south, spending most
          of the afternoon on dual carriageways and motorways. I ended up
          in Great Gransden, west of Cambridge, in a soggy field (no wonder
          having had a lot of rain in a short time). Had a quick look at St.
          Neots, which might have it's points, and Abbotsley, a quaint village
          with a lot of thatched roofs (which seems very common in this
          area).</p>

        <p>Monday (18/6) and time to see some of the area around Cambridge.
          Started of at <a href="IMG_4992.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Bourn Mill</a>, the oldest
          windmill in England (?). Then headed north towards St. Ives (where
          the rain started pouring down), where I found a sign to <a href="IMG_4995.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Graveley</a>
          and <a href="IMG_5003.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Graveley Way</a>. :-) A quick look
          at some of the drainage ditches, which can be long and straight.
          Now I can say that I have been to America! Let it be that it's
          just outside Sutton, but I've been there. :-) Rain stopped when
          I arrived in Ely, where the <a href="IMG_5005.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">cathedral</a>
          dominates the skyline. Next was another tour down memory lane
          with a visit to Cambridge, where I found a Wildflower Garden
          (so my garden wasn't messy, it preserved flowers!). Reencountered
          <a href="IMG_5035.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">the punts</a> and the collages, and I most
          likely looked like an idiot showing more interested in the <a
          href="IMG_5051.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">clouds and architecture</a> than the parying
          students. Obviously studying at an old university doesn't make
          you <a href="IMG_5064.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">more intelligent</a>. :-) Supper was
          had watching the sunset while enjoying a local ale.</p>

        <p>Tuesday (19/6) and a last move, before the drive to the ferry, and
          I ended up in Dovercourt, a stone's throw from Harwich and the
          docks. The night sky was lit by astounding lightnings.</p>

        <p>Wednesday (20/6) and time for a 'wee ride' down the coast to
          Clacton-on-Sea to see yet more seaside resorts. Started at
          Walton-on-the-Naze and it's <a href="IMG_5085.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">beach huts</a>.
          In Frinton-on-Sea I found another <a href="IMG_5092.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">old
          railway crossing</a>, worked by hand. In great tradition I found
          some blokes flying <a href="IMG_5095.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">kites</a> outside
          Holland-on-Sea. The coast turned out less commercial than Skegness
          baring the piers, like the one <a href="IMG_5099.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">at Clacton</a>.</p>

        <p>Thursday (21/6) and time to take the ferry to Denmark. With
          'nothing' really to do on the ferry, I tried to capture some nice
          views, like the three <a href="IMG_5130.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">lighthouse boats</a>.</p>

        <p>Friday (22/6 - Midsummer's Eve, at least in Sweden) and I arrived
          in a nice sunny Denmark, greated by a more agreeable "<a href="IMG_5161.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="june2">Humanity
          and the Sea</a>" this time.</p>

        <p>End of travel</p>
