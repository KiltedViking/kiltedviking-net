        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the middle of April 2007 I drove down to Esbjerg, Denmark,
          to catch the ferry to Harwich (as the Gothenburg-Newcastle ferry
          not longer sails) and then north into Scotland (with my 'new'
          caravan, a Cabby 532 DLX, also from 1987, if you must know :-).</p>
        <p>This trip has been split into five parts: April, May parts 1 and 2, and
          June parts 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>In this first part, I travelled from Eskilstuna to Esbjerg to catch
          ferry to Harwich, and then headed up to Lake Distict before heading along
          Scotland's Southwest coast.
        </p>

        <h2>May, part 1</h2>

        <h3>Annan to Glenluce (continued)</h3>

        <p>Tueday (1/5) and time to look at the ferries to Irland ... Started
          of by looking at <a href="IMG_2669.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Glenluce Abbey</a> (I was
          obviously born 407 years, to the day, to late to greet Mary Queen of
          Scots on her visit) and a restored <a href="IMG_2689.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">tower
          house</a> (Castle of Park, or sometimes locally called House of
          Hay?; only external view as it can be rented). Next was a visit
          to Stranraer with <a href="IMG_2699.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Castle of St. John</a>
          and <a href="IMG_2710.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">railway station</a>. After a late lunch
          I headed south to the old port (for Ireland) of <a href="IMG_2715.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Portpatrick</a>,
          where I got my first <a href="IMG_2711.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">view of Ireland</a>.<br>
          (Glenluce Abbey is one of the few abbeys where a village/town
          didn't establish around itand ferries to Ireland moved from Portpatrick
          to the more sheltered Stranraer in Loch Ryan.)</p>

        <p>Headed south (2/5) to <a href="IMG_2716.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Port William</a>
          and <a href="IMG_2729.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Isle of Whithorn</a> and St. Ninian's
          chapel. Headed north again to Sorbie with it's motte (only the
          motte, or mound, left because built in wood) and Clan Hannay's
          <a href="IMG_2742.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">tower house</a>. Lunch was had in Wigtown
          overlooking the <a href="IMG_2747.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">town hall</a> before heading
          for the <a href="IMG_2751.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">harbour</a> in a marsh. On the way
          back I visited <a href="IMG_2759.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Torhouse Stone Circle</a>.<br>
          (Isle of Whithorn was a place of pilgrimage, where the pilgrims
          passed Glenluce abbey on their way there.<br>
          Wigtown is called the book town as it has many bookshops. Before
          that they where a thriving port and had a distillery, which has
          started up again. Once upon a time there was a castle in the marsh
          below Wigtown, but now it's gone and the area is preserved for
          birds.)</p>

        <h3>Glenluce to Culzean/Maybole</h3>

        <p>Time to move on and next stop was Culzean (3/5). (Found the camp site
          full but the one across the road, at a farm, put me up for the
          night.) Quick visit to Maybole and then took the coastal road to
          Ayr, during which I got a nice <a href="IMG_2766.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">view</a>
          of Arran and Kintyre. In Ayr I got a look at, what's left, of
          Cromwell's Citadel. Headed back to Maybole to pick up a Madras
          curry. Realised that the <a href="IMG_2778.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">view</a> from my
          caravan was a good one of Arran, even a bit '<a href="IMG_2784.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">mystical</a>'.<br>
          (Arran is an island of the west coast, also known as Britain,
          of is it Scotland?, in miniature - flat in the south and hilly
          in the north. Kintyre is a mainland island, i.e. is connected
          to the mainland by a narrow strip of land.<br>
          Cromwell was the reason for the English Civil War, i.e 'republicans'
          fighting royalists. I use quotes for 'republicans' as Cromwell
          was somewhat of a dictator.)</p>

        <p>Time again (4/5) to move, this time only around the corner: Maybole.
          Had lunch (with <a href="IMG_2786.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">spectators</a>) overlooking
          <a href="IMG_2793.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Crossraguel Abbey</a> (i.e. making good
          use of my membership in Historic Scotland :-). Climbed the tower
          of the <a href="IMG_2801.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">abbey's gatehouse</a> and got an even
          <a href="IMG_2812.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">better view</a> of the abbey (and nearby
          tower house, most likely built with stone from the abbey, in the
          background to the left). After a nice talk to the attendant I
          moved on to Girvan and it's <a href="IMG_2846.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Stumpy Tower</a>,
          a former jail. There I got a closer look at <a href="IMG_2848.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Ailsa
          Craig</a> (an island outside Girvan).<br>
          (Girvan's Stumpy Tower was extended with a town hall, McMaster's
          Hall, in 1911, but the hall burnt down in 1939.)</p>

        <p>Saturday (5/5) and time to have a look at <a href="IMG_2863.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Culzean
          Castle</a> and <a href="IMG_2880.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Park</a> (for bl**dy £12).
          (It's one of the most expensive walks I've had: £3/hour!) The
          castle is pretty 'modern' and General Eisenhower was given a
          suite/wing to live in, i.e. there is an exhibition about him and
          WWII. The Swan lake (pond?) is a nice place to have an ice cream
          on a nice day and the walled garden has quite a few flowers,
          fruit trees, and <a href="IMG_2899.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">other plants</a>. Their
          <a href="IMG_2905.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">tulip collection</a> 
          and '<a href="IMG_2901.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">time
          piece</a>' were exellent! (But the gas works and powder house
          where both disappointing.) Headed north to have a look at what
          'north of Ayr' was like and ended up in Troon for supper.</p>

        <p>Sunday (6/5) and the Met Office was right: it rained heavily (well
          at least to start with). Maybe time for a rest from touristing
          (as to not get TFS - tourist fatigue syndrome :-).<br>
          After lunch at Ayr's beach it was time to see some of Ayrshire's
          inland. I took a quick afternoon tour via Cumnock and New Cumnock
          (in the rain), where I found <a href="IMG_2911.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">nice hilly
          nature</a> (and that that doesn't stop humanity destroying it
          with opencast coal mining and industry).<br>
          Later I have learnt that I went through Patna where my great
          grandfather was a minister before he moved to Newtyle.</p>

        <p>Monday (7/5) and bank holiday, and I was hoping to visit <a href="IMG_2916.JPG" 
          data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Dunaskin
          Heritage Centre</a> (at an old iron works). I looked very closed
          and I met a nice man and his dog that confirmed it... only the
          railway museum (run by volunteers) is still running. So time for
          plan B and a visit to <a href="IMG_2924.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Loch Doon Castle</a>.
          The castle ruin was moved from <a href="IMG_2925.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">an island</a>
          in the loch when the level of the water was raised by building
          a dam in the 1930s.<br>
          Headed for the coast again where I tried to see if the rumours
          about 'Electric Brae' (Croy Brae) where true, i.e. that a car
          will 'move uphill'. (The truth is that it's an illusion where
          the surroundings make it look like it's uphill when it's actually
          downhill. :-) Got a nice shot of <a href="IMG_2951.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Culzean
          Castle</a> from another side (as well as Ailsa Craig).<br>
          (I also learnt that the military spent a lot of money in building
          an air gunnery school at Loch Doon against advise from locals.
          The locals where right about the weather conditions and the installations
          where removed 18 months later.)</p>

        <h3>Maybole to Lochgilphead</h3>

        <p>Time to move on (8/5) and this time to <a href="IMG_2963.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Loch
          Lomond</a> and Balloch, where the paddle steamer <a href="IMG_2961.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Maid
          of the Loch</a> is moored (not working). Went up the <a href="IMG_2968.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">west
          shore</a> to <a href="IMG_2985.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Luss</a>, a small and very
          nice village.<br>
          (For the nerds: I found <a href="IMG_2996.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Mr. Dell's cottage</a>
          in Luss! :-)<br>
          (I've been told that the Maid of the Loch was built on the Clyde
          and then transported in sections, via River Leven, to Loch Lomond.)</p>

        <p>As expected staying at Loch Lomond is expensive, so time to move
          on (9/5). This time I decided not to continue along the terrible
          road north of Tarbet (that I seem to like calling Tarbert...) and
          headed west (through <a href="IMG_3000.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">a nice pass</a>) this
          year to <a href="IMG_3004.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Lochgilphead</a>. Having set up
          my caravan I headed back to <a href="IMG_3024.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Inveraray</a>,
          that looked historic when I passed it. Doubling back again I passed
          Auchindrain Township, an open air museum showing how farmers lived
          (which I missed, being late, and have to go back to one day).
          The <a href="IMG_3054.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">iron furnace</a> at Furnace was
          seen before going to Kilmartin at it's many prehistoric monuments.
          There are great <a href="IMG_3073.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">stone slabs</a> in Kilmartin's
          churchyard as well as <a href="IMG_3089.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">standing stones</a>,
          <a href="IMG_3094.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">stone circles</a>, 
          <a href="IMG_3103.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">chambered
          cairns</a>, and <a href="IMG_3128.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">stone carvings</a> in the
          fields. There are five cairns in a row through Kilmartin Glen,
          known as linear cemetery (stretching from Kilmartin in the north
          to Ri Cruin in the south).<br>
          (On the road from Tarbet to Lochgilphead AA has missed a steep
          gradient, i.e. over 10%, in their 2007 road map, so the road is
          just a notch better than the one north of Tarbet. Why this is
          annoys me is because they aren't fun when towing a caravan... I'm
          a bit annoyed with myself for missing Rest and be thankful on the
          way.<br>
          On the other hand I found another kind, than those in Fife, of
          <a href="IMG_3076.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">mile markers</a>, this one giving the distance
          to Oban and Lochgilphead [shown as L'G'HEAD].<br>
          And the stone circles in Kilmartin are most likely filled with
          stones from 'modern day' people, i.e. not in prehistoric time.)</p>

        <p>Thursday (10/5) and I thought I would head for Mull of Kintyre
          and see the extension of Giant's Causeway (in Ireland). Luckily
          I stopped to ask at the tourist information in <a href="IMG_3132.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Tarbert</a>
          (not Tarbet :-) and got the illusion out of my head. I got some
          good pointers and headed south for Campbeltown (where, on the
          way, I got my first, and closest, look at <a href="IMG_3137.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Islay</a>
          ... and the <a href="IMG_3140.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">paps of Jura</a>). The tour
          continued <a href="IMG_3143.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">south</a> to Southend (which
          wasn't much...  but had a <a href="IMG_3158.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">nice view</a>,
          with Aisla Craig :-) and almost to the lighthouse on Mull of Kintyre.
          The way back was via the <a href="IMG_3171.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">scenic route</a>, with views of Arran,
          and <a href="IMG_3193.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Skipness 
            Castle</a> and <a href="IMG_3211.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">chapel</a>
          (with Arran in background :-). Stopped for a look at the <a href="IMG_3217.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">ferry
          to Islay</a> and to look at the <a href="IMG_3219.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">rainbow</a></p>

        <p>Friday (11/5) and time to see <a href="IMG_3223.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Crinan Canal</a>
          (Ardrishaig to Crinan), where I found an old canal <a href="IMG_3233.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">steam
          tugboat</a>. Continued south to <a href="IMG_3237.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Kilmory Knap Chapel</a>
          with yet more <a href="IMG_3240.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">grave stones</a>. Heading
          north again I saw some sea otters (I think :-) and stopped at
          <a href="IMG_3280.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Castle Sween</a>. Still having time before
          supper I headed north of Kilmartin to <a href="IMG_3306.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Carnassarie
          Castle</a>. This castle is interesting as it is built as a tower
          house with an adjoining hall block, but both built at the same
          time. (Normal was to build the tower house and then, in later
          years, expand the castle with a hall block.)</p>

        <h3>Lochgilphead to Oban</h3>

        <p>Having moved (12/5) to <a href="IMG_3337.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Oban</a> I toured
          the town, where I found <a href="IMG_3335.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">M/S Stockholm</a>
          (ironically registred in Gothenburg :-) and Ronja Viking from
          Norway. Next I visited visited <a href="IMG_3360.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Dunstaffnage
          castle</a> (where Flora McDonald was held for a while) and chapel.
          I just had to cross the old <a href="IMG_3390.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">railway and
          road bridge</a> at Connel (which was worth the tea and <a href="IMG_3394.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">view</a>
          :-)). Made the 'compulsory' visit to <a href="IMG_3397.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">McCaig's
          Tower</a>, the <a href="IMG_3400.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">uncompleted folly</a> above
          town, where there is a <a href="IMG_3403.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">great view</a> of
          Mull. Had fish and chips on the north pier (during which time
          M/S Stockholm <a href="IMG_3410.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">took off</a>) while waiting
          for the paddle steamer <a href="IMG_3439.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Waverley</a> to
          return from it's day trip.<br>
          (The paddle steamer Waverley used to be a ferry passengers on the west
          coast of Scotland. It has for the last 32 years been sailing on
          pleasure excursions.<br>
          And once again AA has missed steep gradients in their 2007 road
          map!)</p>

        <p>Sunday (13/5) and time to see Waverley <a href="IMG_3463.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">depart</a>
          (backwards, if you're wondering :-) for Iona before visiting
          <a href="IMG_3476.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Bonawe furnace</a>. After a lunch on the
          <a href="IMG_3544.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">beach of Loch Etive</a> and have a look
          at <a href="IMG_3557.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Loch 
            Awe</a>, <a href="IMG_3567.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">railway
          bridge</a> over River Orchy, and <a href="IMG_3571.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Kilchurn
          Castle</a>.</p>

        <h3>Oban to Fort William</h3>

        <p>Headed (14/5) for Fort William to stay in Glen Nevis, after having
          stopped to look at <a href="IMG_3605.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Castle Stalker</a>. Visited
          the <a href="IMG_3620.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Glenfinnan Monument</a> at Loch Shiel
          (which wasn't worth the £2 parking fee and £3 entrance fee, although
          I paid for the parking; the drive back to Fort William was nice
          though, having a view of <a href="IMG_3630.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Ben Nevis</a>
          with snow on it's top). Also saw the famous 'Harry Potter railway
          bridge', i.e. <a href="IMG_3617.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Glenfinnan Viaduct</a>. Had
          a walk through town and a look at, what's left of, <a href="IMG_3641.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">the
          fort</a>. The day ended <a href="IMG_3643.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">better</a> than
          it started. :-) (... even though I found out that I'm a week to
          early for the steam train to Mallaig.)<br>
          (Castle Stalker is renovated, i.e. inhabitable, and in private
          ownership.<br>
          Glenfinnan Monument is erected at the head of Loch Shiel where
          Bonnie Prince Charles is said to have raised his standard [flag],
          on 19th August 1745, in his attempt to reclaim the throne for his
          father. It failed after the battle of Culloden at Inverness in
          April 1746.<br>
          Fort William, one of three forts along the Great Glen
          and Loch Ness, is the English king's attempt to keep the Scots
          in check. The grounds of the fort was bought by a railway company
          to build a terminus and thereby destroyed the fort.)</p>

        <p>Tuesday (15/5) turned out a nice day after a pretty cold night,
          at least when <a href="IMG_3650.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">the mist</a> had lifted,
          and it was time to head further <a href="IMG_3659.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">up the
          glen</a>. Lots of nice <a href="IMG_3693.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">water falls</a>
          and <a href="IMG_3692.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">burns</a> with clear water, and nice
          views of snow clad mountain tops. Lunch was had overlooking
          <a href="IMG_3740.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Neptune's Staircase</a>, i.e. the sea locks
          at Banavie. For some reason I turned right instead of left when
          leaving the locks and ended up at Gairlochy (where the lock keepers where
          'playing' with the <a href="IMG_3761.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">swing bridge</a> and
          lock gates). Here I met a nice man from York (originally from
          Surrey) whom I had a nice chat about this and that. Next was the
          Commando Memorial with a view of <a href="IMG_3773.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Ben Nevis</a>
          and other mountains (which where hidden in clouds when I passed
          here last year). On the way back I stopped at <a href="IMG_3795.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">Inverlochy
          Castle</a> and the <a href="IMG_3794.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="may1">railway bridge</a> over
          River Lochy.</p>
