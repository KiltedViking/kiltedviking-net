        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Time for the 13th Urkult, a music festival held in a small village
          called Näsåker in the north of Sweden. The village, and the festival
          ground, is situated along Ångermanälven (the Ångerman River).
          As last year, I volonteered as a driver.
          Here are some photos from the weekend of the 13th Urkult and my
          travel there and &quot;back&quot; (not heading straight back to
          Eskilstuna?).</p>

        <h3>The trip north</h3>

        <p>I left Eskilstuna on the 27/7 and headed for Hudiksvall, where I
          found my first full Swedish camp site. So I continued to Harmånger
          on the E4 road, where I stayed for two nights. I did a quick tour
          of Harmånger (while waiting for my pizza, which seemed time enough
          :-) and to the coast. Nothing much to report except a nice church
          with separate steeple, some industrial history, and nice views
          out over the Baltic Sea (or is it Gulf of Bothnia? ...or both?).
          Moved on to Ramvik (south of the High Coast, i.e. close to the
          mouth of Ångermanälven) for another two nights. Gave Kramfors
          another try... and I got a nice 'pizza roll', but otherwise not
          considering another visit. Saw, and crossed, both Sandöbron (the
          'old' bridge) and High Coast Bridge (the 'new' bridge). Got some
          company from Peter and friend, whom I had supper with overlooking
          <a href="IMG_5226.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="urkult07">the lake</a>.</p>

        <h3>Näsåker</h3>

        <p>I arrived on Tuesday afternoon (31/7) and set up my caravan on
          a car park (with permission), yet again with the help of Wabbit.
          :-) Headed for Härnösand on Wednesday (1/8) to collect Terra Nova,
          a danish theatrical group.</p>

        <p>Went to Sundsvall on the Thursday (2/8), in company of Alexander
          that was leaving, where I almost '<a href="IMG_5235.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="urkult07">dropped
          in on Leif</a>'. :-) Picked up Suranjana from Mynta and Bonus
          the drum teacher (and friend), who gave me a private consert.
          On arrival at Näsåker it was a bit wet, and I saw my first
          '<a href="IMG_5239.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="urkult07">double rainbow</a>'. Thursday is also
          '<a href="IMG_5246.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="urkult07">fire night</a>' (<em>eldnatta</em>, difficult
          to photograph with my cheap camera, but nice effect... or not
          :-).</p>

        <p>Friday (3/8) and only did some local driving, i.e. could enjoy all
          the music I wanted. The evening was a bit wet, but I still got
          'a shot' of my <a href="IMG_5262.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="urkult07">favorite view</a>. :-)</p>

        <p>Got to get up early on Saturday (4/8) for a 7 a.m. drive to Sundsvall to leave
          Suranjana (from Mynta), and Sofia Karlsson and band. Arrived back
          early and could enjoy all the music I wanted again.</p>

        <p>Headed back to Härnösand on the Sunday (5/8) to leave half of
          Terra Nova and most of Fata Morgana. Had a nice supper back in
          Näsåker and got, for the staff, private show from Big Ass BBQ,
          a <b>very</b> entertaining show where one can't help laughing.
          :-)</p>

        <h3>The trip south</h3>

        <p>Left for Östersund on the Monday (6/8). Made a quick tour of
          Frösön on the Tuesday (7/8) and saw the church (which I thought
          would have a tower used for defense, but alas not...). 'Chilled'
          on the Wednesday and headed to Brunflo on the Thursday (9/8) to
          see '<a href="IMG_5287.JPG" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="urkult07">the tower</a>' (that I thought I would
          see on Frösön). (WordFinder want's the Swedish word for the tower,
          <em>kastell</em>, translated to 'citadel'... hmmm... I'll have
          to look into that!)</p>

        <p>On the Friday (10/8) I drove to Ljusdal. Had a wee peek at the
          town with it's many lovely houses. Took a trip to Färila for a
          wee strol, shopping, and supper on the Sunday (11/8).</p>

        <p>Monday (13/8) and I moved to Falun. I was aiming for Ludvika
          but I felt I had used up my drive time quota for the day. :-)</p>

        <p>Wednesday (15/8) and I finally made it to Ludvika. :-) Spent
          Friday (16/8) afternoon looking at Smedjebacken - the end of
          Strömsholm's canal (where the railway was used for the last leg to
          Ludvika and the next lake system).</p>

        <p>Saturday (18/8) and I felt the need to move again - this time
          to Kristinehamn.</p>

        <p>Monday (20/8) and time to move again?????</p>
