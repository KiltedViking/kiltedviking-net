                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Shetland had been on my wishlist for a while, and it didn't let
                    me down! ;-) I found dramatic nature and lovely views, as well
                    as sun, rain, wind, bogs, and puffins, but luckely no midges (yet). 
                    ;-) (I also found some places shown in TV series Shetland, and
                    later also Vera when visiting Whitley Bay - both based on books
                    by Ann Cleeves. ;-))
                </p>

                <p>Preferring to stay on the ground, I headed for the most northerly 
                    ferry to Britain - IJmuiden, Netherland, to Newcastle - and then
                    on to Aberdeen for ferry to Lerwick. Heading back I visited 
                    Grantown-on-Spey, Cupar and Whitley Bay, before leaving Britain.
                </p>

                <p> I took about 1.400 photos with my DSLR camera and phone, showing 
                    68 on this page, and filmed my walks - unedited recordings that 
                    can be found on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kiltedviking"

                    (really) started with a tour of IJmuiden and its sanddunes.

                <h2>Eight days on Shetland</h2>
                <p>I arrived in Lerwick with ferry on 7 July 
                    and headed straight for the far North of the Mainland, stopping to have
                    coffee at Mavis Grind, an isthmus where boats were dragged from
                    one side to the other (which I know as tarbet from West coast 
                    of Scotland).</p>

                <p>I had found a walk around

                    to Shetland walks, which was and excellent idea, walking along
                    the dramatic East coast of headland with a view of Yell on the other side
                    of the water and

                <p>Running out of time, I hadn't got time to head out to the lighthouse... 
                    But having checked in at Westings Inn, I was consoled with an 
                    excellent view from my room and while having breakfast the next day!

                <h3>Heading South</h3>
                <p>Time for exploring places from family's past - Grantown-on-Spey,
                    Pitlochry and Newtyle, among them - after visiting

                    and stopping off for the night in Perth.
                </p>

                <h3>Cupar and Newtyle (19th - 21st)</h3>
                <img src="strips/IMG_1261_Cairngorms_660x82.jpg" alt="View towards Cairngorm mountains"
                    class="img-fluid mb-4">

                <p>Visit to Cupar started off with a visit to Granny's and her parent's
                    graves in Newtyle and a nice lunch in Meigle, stopping of at

                    stone</a>. Walking to shop, an interesting set of staircases
                    was found. 
                </p>

                <h3>Kirkcaldy, Abbotsford and Kelso (22nd)</h3>
                <p>Having been given the book Who built Scotland, I decided to tick
                    off more buildings described in the book - 
                    <a href="" data-rbox-image="images/IMG_1280_Maggies_House.jpg" class="lightbox"

                    House</a> in Kirkcaldy, Abbotsford House in Abbotsford and prefab houses in
                    Kelso. The first building was found outside the entrance of Victoria
                    Hospital in Kirkcaldy, the second was skipped of both time constriction
                    and cost, and the third may or may not have been found. :-S

                <p>(This brings me up to having visited 13 of the 25 places in the

                <h3>Whitley Bay and Tynemouth (22nd - 23rd)</h3>
